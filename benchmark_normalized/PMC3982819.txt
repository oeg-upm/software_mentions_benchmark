Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos: Brains were further fixed for 48 hr at 4°C in the fixative paraformaldehyde solution and then submerged in 10% sucrose solution overnight, 20% sucrose solution for 24 hr and 30% sucrose for 48 hr until the brain completely sank. Brain sections of 30 µm thickness were cut using a cryostat (Microm HM550, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) and collected serially in 24-well plates containing PBS (0.02 M, pH 7.2). One out of every eight slices was used for immunostaining for c-Fos protein. Free-floating sections were rinsed with PBS for 10 min three times. Sections were then incubated with 0.3% H 2 O 2 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and rinsed with PBS for 10 min three times. Thereafter, sections were incubated in blocking solution (Block Ace, Snow Brand Milk Products Co., Sapporo, Japan) for 2 hr. Tissue sections were incubated in rabbit anti-Fos primary antibodyQuantification of c-Fos immunoreactive cells: Brain regions were identified using the rat brain in stereotaxic coordinates [19]. The number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the PVN and SON was counted using an Olympus Optical System (BX-51, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan), and the digitized images were analyzed with IPLab image analyzing software (Scanalytics Corp., Fairfax, VA, U.S.A.). A threshold was set to delineate c-Fos-positive stained nuclei from background, and only cells above the threshold were included. Up to four sections per animal for each region were quantified bilaterally and then averaged.
Statistical analyses: All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 11.5 Version (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's test. Differences at P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
