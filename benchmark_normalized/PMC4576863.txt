Mouse hearts were quickly dissected and washed in cold PBS. After removal of the atria, ventricles were lysed in a Precellys ceramic lysing kit tube with 1 ml RIPA buffer by two 30-s cycles at 5,000 rpm in PRECELLYS 24 (Bertin Technologies). Ventricle or adult cardiomyocyte lysates (see the Adult mouse cardiomyocyte isolation section) were then incubated with wheat germ agglutinin-agarose beads in RIPA buffer for 4 h at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min before loading in 4-12% NuPAGE (Life Technologies) precast gels for Western analysis. For the analysis of CamKII, PLB, and Troponin I, hearts were perfused in a Langendorff apparatus as described in the Langendorff heart preparation section with a modified Krebs solution with or without 20 ng/ml BDNF (PeproTech) or 5 µM Forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) used as a positive control. Heart contractility was monitored during the perfusion process and at the peak of cardiac pressure induced by BDNF or Forskolin the hearts were snap frozen with stainless steel clamps cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen before homogenization in RIPA buffer supplemented with proteases (complete mini; Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP; Roche). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatants were diluted in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, and loaded in a gel for Western analysis. Membranes (PVDF; Life Technologies) were blocked in 5% nonfat milk or 5% BSA in TBS-Tween before incubation with a specific antibody. Antibodies were as follows: anti-TrkB (against the extracellular domain of TrkB and therefore recognizing all TrkB isoforms; EMD Millipore), anti-TrkB.T1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-GAPDH (EMD Millipore), anti-CaV 1.2a1c (L-Type calcium channel subunit a1c,; Alomone Lab), anti-HA (for Western, Covance; for immunoprecipitation, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Phospho-TrkB raised against phosphorylated TrkB-Tyr516 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-total CAMKII (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CAMKII P-T286/T287 (Cell Signaling Technology), antitotal Phospholamban (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-Phospholamban P-S16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Phospholamban P-T17 (Badrilla), and anti-total and P-Ser 23/24 Troponin I (Cell Signaling Technology). After incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, membranes were incubated with ECL substrate for detection of HRP enzyme activity (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized in a Syngene gel documentation system. Images were splined (Arganda-Carreras et al., 2006) as needed and quantified by ImageJ analysis (National Institutes of Health). Student's t test was used for statistical significance assessment.
Male mice (2 mo, 19-25 g) were injected with heparin (5,000 U/kg i.p.) and after 10 min were anesthetized with Avertin (150 mg/kg i.p.). Hearts were quickly removed from the chest and put into 16-18°C calcium-free modified Krebs solution containing 118 mmol NaCl, 23 mmol NaHCO 3 , 3.2 mmol KCl, 1.2 mmol KH 2 PO 4 , 1.2 mmol MgSO 4 , 11 mmol glucose, and 2 mmol sodium pyruvate before being mounted in a Langendorff perfusion system (Broadley, 1979). Hearts were perfused with modified Krebs solution containing 1.5 mM CaCl 2 (37.5°C) via the aorta. All solutions were bubbled with 95% O 2 -5% CO 2 , pH 7.40, and kept at 37°C. An inflatable water-filled balloon was inserted into the left ventricle via a small incision in the left atrium for measurement of the left ventricle pressure (BIOPAC Systems Inc.). Perfusion pressure and coronary flow were also continuously monitored via a differential pressure transducer. All channels were fed to a digidata 1322a (Axon) for digitalization storage and analysis using Igor 4.0 (Wave- Metrics) or Clampfit (Axon) software.
Calcium tolerant adult cardiomyocytes were loaded with Indo1-AM for 1 h, washed with control solution, and left at room temperature for at least 45 min to allow deesterification of the dye. Loading solution was prepared from a control solution containing 0.2 mM Ca 2+ and 1 mM Indo1-AM (1 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide; Life Technologies) dissolved first in Pluronic surfactant (PowerLoad 100×; Life Technology) with 1 mg/ml BSA. Cardiomyocytes were field stimulated (0.5/s) with platinum electrodes (FHC Inc.) and recordings were made at 27°C in 1 mM Ca 2+ solution. BDNF was applied at 50 ng/ml using a picospritzer at 30 hPa and a glass pipette with 1-M Ohm tip resistance. Excited at 340 nM, indo1-AM emission was split into two channels and passed through 405/10-nm (calcium-bound emission) and 488/10-nm (calcium-free emission) fluorescence filters. Light collected by photodiodes (Till Photonics) was digitally converted at 10 KHz (pClamp 10 and Digidata 1322a) and computed and the information was stored.
Ca 2+ -tolerant cardiomyocytes cells were placed in a recording chamber and perfused with a Na + -free solution containing 137 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM Hepes, and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4 with TEA-OH) at a flux of 1 ml/min at 27°C. The pipette solution contained 111 mM CsCl, 20 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mM glucose, 14 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, and 5 mM MgATP (pH 7.3 with CsOH). Pulled borosilicate glass pipettes at ∼3-4 MOhm filled with pipette solution were used to obtain gigaseal on cardiomyocytes and subsequent whole-cell voltage clamp. Currents (I Ca−L ) were elicited by applying depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of −60 mV (-50 mV to +70 mV, 10-mV increments) and recorded (filtered at 2 kHz through a 4-pole low-pass Bessel filter and digitized at 5 kHz) with a Multiclamp 700B (Axon) using pClamp software (Axon). The maximum absolute value of the current obtained (in pA) was divided by the cell capacitance (in pF).
