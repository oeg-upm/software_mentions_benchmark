To investigate the hypothesis of this study SPSS version 22 for Windows was used. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and one-way repeated ANOVA for repeated data were conducted. The aim of the one-way ANOVA was to compare the averages of several physiological parameters relative to the groups; a difference in the mean physiological parameter values of the three groups would result in a statistical difference between subjects classified as heteroschematic male, isoschematic, and heteroschematic female. Accordingly, the calculated P-value would be less than the adopted significance level (5%).
