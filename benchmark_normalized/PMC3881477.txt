To determine whether there were differences between the NJF group and the control group, the independent ttest was performed on subject characteristics. Two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons (Bonferroni test) were used to test for statistically significant differences, and the factors were intervention and group. If a significant interaction was found, the paired t-test was performed to compare before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS Ver. 17.0 for Windows. The level of statistical significance was chosen as 0.05.
