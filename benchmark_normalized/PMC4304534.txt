Statistics were calculated using SPSS Statistics 21 for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Normal distributions were tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The Levene's test was applied assessing the homogeneity of variances for between-group comparisons. Baseline overall cognitive state and differences in demographics between groups, selected and unselected participants of the CT, and drop-outs and completers of the CPT were compared between groups. We used t-tests for independent samples to compare the age, Mann-Whitney tests to compare performance in DemTect and education, and chi-square tests for the comparison of the sex distribution, each with a significance level of α=0.05. G*Power (http://www.gpower.hhu.de) was used to estimate the achieved power with a post hoc analysis. 37
Gains from CT from pre-to post-test and to 1 year follow-up were estimated with analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures (rANOVAs) with a significance level of α=0.05. Due to the intercorrelations between the different cognitive variables (eg, DemTect subscores with the total score), a multivariate analysis was not appropriate. The within-subject variable Time had three levels (pretest vs post-test vs follow-up). The between-subject variable Training had two levels (CPT vs pure CT). The interaction Time × Training was used to specify which training group showed stronger effects. We report Greenhouse-Geisser values to handle possible violations of sphericity. The effect size partial η² (η p ²) is reported, indicating a small (η p ².0.01), moderate (η p ².0.06), or strong effect (η p ².0.14). 38 In a second step, post hoc pairwise comparisons were calculated for the significant Time effects of the rANOVAs. The Bonferroni correction of SPSS was used to prevent an inflated type I error, with an overall value of α=0.05. Here, the effect size d is reported, indicating a small (d.0.10), moderate (d.0.30), or strong effect (d.0.50). 38 If variables violated the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variances, the Friedman's ANOVA was used as a nonparametric equivalent. The effect size ω is reported, indicating a small (ω.0.10), moderate (ω.0.30), or strong effect (ω.0.50). 38 The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used in this case to compare the gains achieved within the training groups as a post hoc test for the significant variables of the Friedman's ANOVAs. The Bonferroni procedure was applied manually to prevent an inflated type I error (α=0.05/ comparisons per group). The effect size ϕ is reported, indicating a small (ϕ.0.10), moderate (ϕ.0.30), or strong effect (ϕ.0.50). 38 The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to estimate between-group differences at the three test points with the value α=0.05.
