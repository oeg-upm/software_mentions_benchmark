Rituximab-binding analysis was performed according to our previously developed imaging-based procedure, with some modifications. 6 Briefly, approximately ten thousands cells of purified living lymphoma cells using a Dead cell removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec) were incubated with 10 mg/ml of anti-CD19 mAb labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) and rituximab labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4 1C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline two times and were then suspended in 4 ml of RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mg/ ml of Hoechist 33 342. The cell suspension was pipetted into a well made of silicon, 2.5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in depth, on a piece of cover glass. Images were collected by means of an OLYMPUS PlanApo Â 60 oil objective in an OLYMPUS FV-1000 confocal microscope (OLYMPUS). The fluorophore was excited by laser at 405, 488 or 633 nm. The cells were optically sectioned along the z-axis, and the images were collected at 640 Â 640 pixel resolution in a sequential mode to minimize the crossover between channels. The step size in the z-axis was 0.5 mm. For three-dimensional reconstruction, twodimensional confocal stacks were saved in an Olympus.oib format and three-dimensional images were generated using Fluoview software (OLYMPUS).
