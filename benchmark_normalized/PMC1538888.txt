The one-against-all on SCOP90 function is designed to find structural neighbors of a protein of interest in the structure classification of proteins (SCOP) (23) database. One of the following three input options (left panel in Figure 1b and user guide 3.1.1) is available for the search: a structure domain already in SCOP 90 (SCOP version 1.55, <90% sequence identity non-redundant set), a structure in the current Protein Data Bank (PDB; the server updates its local PDB weekly) (24) with a specified chain (PDB ID option), or a structure in PDB format uploaded by user (User's structure option). All of the three inputs can be accompanied with optional parameter settings for customized output. The parameters that could be changed from default include minimum rough Z-score [for the alignment prior to refinement (21)], minimum refined Z-score, maximum root mean square deviation (RMSD) of Ca superposition between two aligned protein chains, minimum aligned sequence identity, maximum number of shown matches, and sorting options (right panel in Figure 1b and user guide 3.1.2). Unlike the first input option, for which pre-computed results will be retrieved, the last two input options require entry of user's e-mail address (user guide 3.1.3) because the OPAAS server needs time for computation and will return the result via email in, typically, minutes to hours, depending mainly on the stringency of the selected parameters.
