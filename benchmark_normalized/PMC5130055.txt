In vivo micro-CT Specimen scans were performed with a SkyScan 1172 high-resolution micro-CT (SkyScan N.V., Kontich, Belgium). Prior to scanning the specimens, a calibration scan was performed using synthetic bone, water, and air samples. The exposure parameters were 70 kV and 140 mA. The number of projections was 481 and there were 938 cross-sections. The total scan time was 20 min. The scanned images were reconstructed using SkyScan CT-Analyser software and a modified cone-beam algorithm 14 with 0.027 mm30.027 mm30.027 mm isotropic voxel spacing. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) image was then traced to the circumference of the original defect margins. This allowed the creation of a 3D reconstruction of the defect, which here after was referred to as the region of interest. The region of interest of each specimen was analysed for tissue volume (TV), bone volume (BV), bone volume fraction (BVF, BV/TV) and bone mineral density (BMD).
The quantitative data distribution was assessed using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Because a non-normal distribution was detected, a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks was performed. When the Kruskal-Wallis test result was significant (P,0.05), a post hoc Tukey test was used to identify the significantly different group means. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
