Sections were viewed using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope with ×10, ×20 and ×60 objectives. Images were captured using an Olympus XM10 monochrome camera in 16-bit digital format and examined using Image J software (National Institutes of Health).
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, with n indicating the number of animals, strips or independent in vitro experiments used for a particular set of experiments. For in vitro experiments in recombinant models, isotherms were analysed by a nonlinear regression (Prism, GraphPad) to yield IC 50 values. K b values of antagonists for inhibition of agonist action were calculated according to Lazareno and Birdsall calculation: (Lazareno and Birdsall, 1993), where [agonist] is the concentration of TFLLR-NH 2 in the test (Lazareno and Birdsall, 1993Statistical analysis of data was carried out using SigmaStat 3.5 software (Systat). For isolated bladder experiments, a two-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison versus vehicle with the Holm-Sidak method was performed only if F achieved P < 0.05, and there was no significant variance in homogeneity. For telemetric experiments, Student's paired t-test and Mann-Whitney rank sum test were used. Values of P < 0.05 were considered to show significant differences between means. The data and statistical analysis comply with the recommendations on experimental design and analysis in pharmacology (Curtis et al., 2015).
In vivo experiments. Telemetry equipment (Data Science International) was interfaced with easyMATRIX and IOX2 (EMKA Technologies). HD-S10 telemetry transmitters were used in conjunction with RPC-1 receivers. For volume measurements, customized IT50 isometric transducers (EMKA Technologies) were used. Weighing signals were converted through an analogue-to-digital IT50 converter (EMKA Technologies). For telemetric, cystometric and voided volume recording, animals were freely moving in customized metabolic cages (Technilab).
