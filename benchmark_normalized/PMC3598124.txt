Data analysis was performed using the Statistica 8 software (StatSoft Polska, Cracow, Poland). Distribution of continuous variables was investigated with the Shapiro-Wilk test in order to check whether the distribution was normal. Descriptive statistics were used as the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. The statistical difference between the suprascapular notch measurements in both sexes were examined using the Mann-Whitney test. A p level of < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.
The present study aimed to establish a new method of classifying the suprascapular notch (SSN) morphology, which, contrary to existing methods, is simple, easy to use, and based on specific geometric parameters that clearly distinguish each type. Based on this classification, the frequency of each type of SSN in females and males was described. To our knowledge, the literature contains no similar study on this subject based on anthropometric evaluation. The type of notch might then be considered in diagnosing the syndrome. The projection in which the SSN is visualized clearly is the anteroposterior projection with the X-ray tube angled 15-30Â°caudally [28].In conclusion, using MultiScanBase v.14.02 software for measurements and typing suprascapular notches, we were able to establish a precise classification of SSN variations, and also, for the first time, present their distribution in female and male scapulas.
