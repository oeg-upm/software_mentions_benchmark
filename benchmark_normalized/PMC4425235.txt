Interventions were placed into natural groupings decided before inspection of the results and agreed with clinical experts: 1. more supported (six or more contacts, or 6 or more weeks in duration), 2. less supported (fewer than six contacts or fewer than 6 weeks in duration). Meta-analyses were performed using a random effects model where studies were judged appropriately homogeneous. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic. All continuous data were presented using a mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and time to event outcomes were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) to account for varying lengths of follow-up. Follow-up time was converted to weeks. The results of the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were multiplied by -1 so that positive differences equated to improved HRQoL. Where HRs were not reported, methods by Parmar et al 18 and Perneger 19 were used. Rates of admissions and ED visits (ie, where patients could have multiple events) were calculated under the assumption that all patients in both arms were followed up for the duration of the study and that the rates were constant over time. All data analyses were undertaken using STATA 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
