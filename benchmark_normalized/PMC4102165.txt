The Restech pH probes were calibrated in pH 7 and pH 4 buffer solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The probe is a 1.5 mm diameter oropharyngeal catheter with a wireless digital transmitter worn externally. The catheter employs a 3.2 mm teardrop-like tip that contains a colored light emitting diode (LED) to aid insertion and to allow visualization of the sensor for proper positioning. The standard catheter was placed in the oropharynx at the level of the uvula. Each volunteer was asked to wear the device for a 24-hour period and was encouraged to participate in normal daily activities. Each subject carried one transmitter/receiver that wirelessly sent data to a monitor worn by the subject. The monitor contains a digital memory card to record events such as meal times, position and chief complaint. Once the pH study was completed, the volunteer returned to have the catheter removed, and the data from the digital recorder were downloaded to a password-protected computer. Data were analyzed with DataView software (version 3; AEMC Instru- ments, Dover, NH, USA). The software generated a graphical tracing of the study events and also created a report of any reflux events. The data collected during meal times were excluded from analysis. It was considered as reflux event when the time of pH reaching to the lowest point was no more than 30 seconds.
