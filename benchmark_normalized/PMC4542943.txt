Target-enriched library pools were again pooled and diluted for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq (W. Harry Feinstone Center for Genomic Research, University of Memphis, Tennessee; 500-cycle kit, Illumina V2 chemistry). The MiSeq controller software was set to trim adapters and deconvolute barcodes; the raw output has been uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (accession SRP057104). Read end trimming was performed in Trimmomatic 0.33 ( Bolger et al., 2014 ) with a sliding window of 20 bp and a quality score of Q20 or greater.
