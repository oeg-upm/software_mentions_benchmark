All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS In- stitute Inc. Cary, NC: 2014). Frequencies were calculated using PROC SURVEYFREQ. The descriptive analyses of energy and food group consumption for the entire day, for the SBP and NSLP meals, and the percent of energy and food groups contributed by school meals were calculated using PROC SURVEYMEAN. All the results were weighted by the estimated sample weights to account for the complex sample design of NHANES, and to enable inferences to the total U.S. population.
