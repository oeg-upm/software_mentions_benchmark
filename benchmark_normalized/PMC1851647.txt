For monitoring the nuclear import of the ATF constructs, HeLa-SUMO cells were seeded on coverslips, grown for 24 h, before mounting in a Life Imaging Services Ludin Chamber kept at 378C, 5% CO 2 , placed in a Leica DMIRE2 microscope equipped with a Life Imaging Services temperature control system. The induction of nuclear importation was triggered by addition of dexamethasone (100 mM) to the cell-culture medium. Images were acquired every 25 s during 15 min, using a Leica DC350FX CCD camera piloted by the Leica FW4000 software. Eight fields (corresponding to a minimum of 60 cells) were recorded during each experiment by the use of a Marzhauser automated stage piloted by the FW4000 software. To compare the intensity of the fluorescent signals in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, the sequences were loaded in the Universal Imaging Metamorph software, and average signal intensity were recorded in regions selected in the perinuclear cytoplasm and inside the nucleus. Signal intensity values were transferred in Microsoft Excel where the cytoplasmic and nuclear signals were compared. The equilibration point refers to the time needed for each construct to reach a signal intensity superior in the nucleus than in the cytoplasmic perinuclear region.
