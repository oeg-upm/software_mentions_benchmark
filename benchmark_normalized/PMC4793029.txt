To measure dynamic balance ability, a star excursion balance test (SEBT) was conducted for each group, because of its high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.88-0.96) 10). For the SEBT, a cross-shaped line was drawn on the floor, with additional lines drawn 45° in eight directions. In this study, only three directions were used (anterior, posterolateral, and posteromedial), according to the study by Hyong 11). The measurements were conducted while the subjects set the heels of their dominant feet at the center point and stretched the feet in the anterior direction as much as possible while maintaining balance. The point where the big toe ended was marked. The posterolateral and posteromedial directions were measured in the same way. Each subject's measurements were taken three times, and the mean value was calculated for each group. In order to minimize errors due to differences in leg length between the subjects, the values were standardized using the formula: measured value/leg length × 100. For the leg length measurements, the distance between the anterior superior iliac spine of the medial malleolus and the tubercle of the shin was measured while the subject was in the supine position. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 12.0, while one-way analysis of variance was used to compare dynamic balance ability among the three groups. The significance level was set to 0.05.
