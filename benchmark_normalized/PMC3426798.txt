Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Weighted data were used in all analyses. Weight 1 was based on the total number of households in each community and the number of participating households per community; weight 2 was based on the total number of people in each household and the number of people sampled per household; weight 3 was used to correct for differences in the sex distribution between our sample and it's population distribution. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) predicting poor SRH by age and gender were calculated and multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between demographic characteristics, clinical measurements and biomarkers with poor SRH, adjusting for age, gender and BMI. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated.
