Statistical analyses were carried out using theStatistical Package for Social Sciences, Windows version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics for each variable were determined. Results for continuous variables without normal distribution were presented as median (interquartile range (IQR)). Statistically significant differences between the groups were determined by the c 2 test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables without normal distribution. Kruskal-Wallis analysis was used to compare means of several groups without normal distribution. Associations between the variables were explored using Spearman's rho (for data that are not normally distributed). Binary logistic regression analysis was also performed to define variables associated with 25(OH)D. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
