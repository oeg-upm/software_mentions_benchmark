Two experienced radiologists (JCS and IK-S) evaluated the image quality, based on the exposure of non-thoracic structures. They determined the most superior and inferior parts of the body, as well as the lateral structures, which had been included within the boundaries of collimation on each chest X-ray. The readers performed their evaluations according to the European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images in Paediatrics [12]. A grading system was used to measure image quality in terms of correct collimation. Inappropriate exposure of abdominal viscera was assumed when the caudal imaging field extended below the level of L1/2 (1 point). Exposure of the cranial structures was considered inappropriate when the collimated field included more than the tip of the mandible (1 point). Inappropriate exposure of the arms was assumed when more than the diametaphyseal junction of the proximal humerus came within the field of view: part of the diaphyseal humerus (1 point); entire humerus (2 points); part of the forearm (1 point); entire forearm (2 points); hand (1 point). The maximum score was 12 points. The image quality in terms of correct collimation was graded arbitrarily as follows: 0 points = optimal image quality; 1-2 points = slightly reduced; 3-4 = moderately reduced; 5-6 = markedly reduced; and >7 points = severely reduced Fig. 1). Rotation and tilting were also recorded. Radiographic errors were recorded on individual tick sheets and the information was captured in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). The readers resolved any differences by consensus.

Student's t test was used to calculate differences between DAPs. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to analyse the correlation between the radiographer's experience in performing X-rays and collimation quality. A level of p < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
