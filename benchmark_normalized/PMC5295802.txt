The target accrual for the correlative serum study was 160 patients to give an 80% power to detect a 0.5 standard deviation (SD) difference in mean serum levels of any of the cytokines between patients with severe and non-severe symptoms, using Wilcoxon rank sum test with a 0.05 twosided type I error. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and rank sum test were used to examine the difference between groups for continuous variables. Fisher's exact test was used to test the association between categorical/binary variables. Multivariable linear and logistic models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used for regression analysis. No adjustment was made for multiple comparisons in this exploratory analysis. All p values were two-sided and a p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. STATA 11.2 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for all analyses.
