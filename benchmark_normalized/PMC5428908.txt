Statistical analyses were made using SPSS Statistics 23.0 (SPSS). Descriptive statistics are presented as mean ± s.d. In comparisons between groups, the independent samples t-test was used for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Correlations were calculated using Pearson correlation (r) for all parameters, except for hsCRP where Spearman correlation (r S ) was used due the skewed distribution of the parameter. All tests were two-tailed, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Linear regression with a stepwise method was run with serum DBP as outcome. Covariates were the parameters significantly associated with serum DBP in the first analyses. The results from the linear regression are presented as unstandardized coefficients (В) and standard error (s.e.).
