The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test if variables were to be normally distributed. A P value >0.05 was required to assume a normal distribution. Data are expressed in terms of median and interquartile range in nonnormal distribution variables and as mean AE standard deviation in normal distribution variables. Comparisons between groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student t test. x 2 or Fisher exact tests were used to analyze the correlation between categorical variables. To calculate the relative correlation of the hs-CRP value, standardized coefficients (b) and 95% CIs were obtained using linear regression models. Univariate and stepwise linear regression analyses were used. The following factors were investigated: PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, O 3 , PM 2.5 , age, PD duration, serum Cr level, white blood cell count (WBC), nPNA, serum albumin, serum total IS, serum total PCS, residual renal function test, intact parathyroid hormone level (iPTH), blood aluminum (Al) level, diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. All the nominal variables in linear regression were transformed into dummy coding. Missing data was approached with listwise deletion. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 12.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
