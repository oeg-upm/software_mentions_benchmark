Descriptive statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington, USA) and SPSS statistics v22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA). Subset analysis was performed on the athletes who sustained a fracture, those who required hospital admittance, and those whose ages ranged from 4 to 7 years. National estimates of youth concussions relating to 9 sports (basketball, baseball, football, gymnastics, hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, and wrestling), LOC, and in the 4-to 7-year age group were also calculated utilizing NEISS hospitals as a stratified national sampling. 16 The Pearson correlation coefficient was obtained to quantify the correlation between individual sports and the overall frequencies of concussions with each successive year. An alpha of .05 and an r > 0.602 indicated statistical significance.
