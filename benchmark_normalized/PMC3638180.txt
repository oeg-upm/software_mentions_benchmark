SAECCOL is an EHR developed and implemented by Colima's SHS. It is based on the MS-SQL Server database management system and Visual Basic was used for the development of the main application and specific modules. It is a modular system (figure 1) that at the time of the study operated mainly in the outpatient and emergency departments, offering support services such as laboratory, imagery, pharmacy, social work and archive modules, the last of which is linked to SSPH's databases. The system allows physicians to record and retrieve the clinical history of patients, as well as all consultation data including drug prescriptions and laboratory studies requested. The system had not been fully implemented in the hospital environment at the time of the study, with working submodules only operating in admissions and the pharmacy department. The archive module also transfers administrative data for the management of the SSPH.
Interviews were conducted by two native Spanish speaking female researchers with experience in qualitative research (August 3-19, 2011, in Colima state and September 1-19, 2011, in Mexico City). A group of experienced, Spanish speaking researchers from INSP and Tulane University read the interview and focus group transcripts to code the data and group them into key concepts and analytical axes. Some of the codes were generated according to the research questions, while others emerged from the interviews. NVivo 9.2 software 22 was used to analyze the data around three analytical axes: design and development of the EHR ( planning and organization, criteria, and requirements), implementation of the EHR (users, constraints, and resources), and the impact of the EHR (benefits, recommendations, and vision for the future) (table 4). Each researcher coded separate interviews. Before starting, a coding exercise was conducted to make sure all researchers were interpreting the codes in the same way and there was constant discussion during the analysis to ensure there was agreement across researchers.
