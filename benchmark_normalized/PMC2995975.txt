Because a majority of the data did not follow a normal distribution, all results presented herein are expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR) or the number (percentage) of patients. Categorical variables were analyzed using the Pearson Ï‡ 2 -test or Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were analyzed using a Mann- Whitney U-test. Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the effects of independent factors on final treatment outcome (excluding uncertain outcomes). Variables with a p value less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis were considered for the multivariate analysis. All P values were two-sided, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were executed using PASW, version 17Drug susceptibility tests were performed as described previously on MAC isolates recovered from 68 patients, and none of the MAC isolates showed resistance to clarithromycin.
