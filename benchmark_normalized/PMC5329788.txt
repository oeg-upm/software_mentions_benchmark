Western blotting analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of DMOG on the expression of VEGF in NCL-H157 cells. The cells were cultured in regular medium with the addition of different concentrations of CIK (concentration of effector-to-target cell ratios (E/T ratio) ranged from 10:1, 20:1 and 30:1). The total protein was harvested from the cultured cells according to standard protocols. Then the protein concentration was measured with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE with 12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies of β-actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz, USA), VEGF (1:500, Santa Cruz, USA). Then the membranes were incubated with gentle agitation for 2 hours at 37°C with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in 5% skim milk powder at 1:7500. After washing three times in Tris-Buffered Saline-Tween-20 (Beyotime, China) (10 minutes each wash), the membranes were developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting detection system. Immunoreactive proteins were then detected by ChemiDoc MP System #170-8280 (Bio-Rad, USA). Images were captured and analyzed by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, USA).
All of the in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate, and data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. Wherever appropriate, the data were subjected to statistical analysis by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for comparison of all pairs of means. A value of P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. SPSS 11.5 for Windows software was used for the statistical analysis. P-values <0.05 were considered significant.
