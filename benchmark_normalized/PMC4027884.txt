Quantification of consumed diet. Eggs were harvested from females caught in the field in Okinawa as above, and 5 larvae were randomly chosen and reared at ambient temperature (approximately 27uC), each in a plastic columnar centrifuge tube with an airtight screw cap (10 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height) to prevent leaves from drying. The quantity of leaves eaten by each larva was monitored every day. One piece of leaf removed from the stalk was supplied at a time. Before being given to a larva, the leaf piece was weighed. Additionally, its image was taken by an image scanner, and its area was measured using the ImageJ 1.44p software (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997-2012). After being eaten, the remaining leaf was replaced every day with a fresh leaf. The area of the remaining leaf was measured every day, and its value was converted into weight, based on the proportion of the original leaf represented by the remnant. This process ensured that the weight eaten each day was recorded as the weight of the fresh leaf.Cs value, 5.38 (60.06) 3 10 2 , was amended due to a typing error in the original paper 15. The same detector was used to measure cesium activity ( 137 Cs only) in pupae. This well-type detector provides maximum efficiency for small samples, because samples can be inserted into a well. Before measurement, dead pupae were air-dried for several months and placed in a columnar plastic container (14 mm in diameter). The detector was calibrated with a standard prepared from the NBL powder standard (New Brunswick Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne, IL, USA). Measurements were performed until the error rate scored less than 10%. Measurements were assumed to be made simultaneously on 15 February 2014 for simplicity, although several days were required to obtain reliable levels of radioactive signals from the pupae. Radioactivity per pupa at the time of ingestion was calculated, assuming thatMortality and abnormality rates. The mortality rate was defined as the percentage of dead individuals at all stages relative to the total number of individuals reared. Thus, the mortality rate excluded only normal adults. In contrast, the abnormality rate reported here could be more accurately called the total abnormality rate. This rate was the percentage of dead individuals at the larval, prepupal, and pupal stages plus the adults that had morphological abnormalities relative to the total number of individuals reared. Thus, the abnormality rate excluded only normal adults that lacked any morphological abnormalities. Correlation analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (2013) and JSTAT 13.0 (2012) (Yokohama, Japan).
Mathematical modeling. We first used the built-in mathematical fit function of Microsoft Excel (2013) to obtain the best-fit curves among available models. All possible models were examined including linear, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, and power function models, and the best possible fit in terms of R 2 values and biological justification was considered to be the most appropriate. Based on equations obtained in this way, we manually calculated the half lethal dose and the half abnormal dose by setting y 5 50(%). Additionally, linear and nonlinear models were examined using the model analysis software JMP 11.0.0 (2013) (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). We reasoned that the simplest mathematical equation with the highest R 2 value, the lowest RMSE, or the lowest information criterion, such as AIC, BIC, and MDL, would be accepted. We examined linear models (including logarithmic scales for power function) and nonlinear models (including logarithmic, square root, quadratic, polynomial, logistic, and exponential equations). Among the model fits performed, logistic 4 P models also showed high R 2 values (R 2 5 0.9972 and BIC 5 19.93 for mortality rate; R 2 5 0.9997 and BIC 5 12.31 for abnormality rate) in addition to the power function models, but the complicated equations with relatively high BIC values discouraged the use of these equations for further analysis.
