All images were analysed at the central core laboratory by two investigators blinded to all patient data and ECG findings. Commercial software (Qmass MR 6.2.1; Leiden, The Netherlands) was used for the analysis.Endocardial and epicardial borders were outlined manually on all end-diastolic and end-systolic short-axis cine slices. LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, LV ejection fraction (EF) and LV mass were then calculated in a standard fashion. The LV maximal wall thickness was automatically measured by the software.
LGE was considered to be present (LGE (+) vs LGE (−) groups) when the signal of any area of the myocardium was highly hyperintense in artefact-free images. Semiautomatic quantification of the LGE mass was made using the 'full width half maximum' (FWHM) method. 29 The extent of LGE was quantified as a percentage of the LV mass. 10 29 30 Statistical analysis Continuous variables were presented as mean±SD. Categorical variables were given as a number and percentage. Between-group differences were assessed using the Pearson χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test (for subgroups containing ≤5 observations) for categorical data and t test for continuous data. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 for all tests. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS V.15 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA).
