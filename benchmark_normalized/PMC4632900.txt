Experiments were performed three times in triplicate. Data was expressed either as percentages of nontreated controls (individual testing) or as percentages of the signal observed for 30 pM E 2 (testing mixtures NFLX-E 2 ). The normality of the distribution of data was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test (p<0.05). To compare data, 1-way ANOVA was applied to normally distributed data, followed by Dunnett's Multiple Comparison post hoc test. For data that were not normally distributed we used KruskalWallis test, followed by Dunnett's Multiple Comparison test. Differences in P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses and graphs were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.
