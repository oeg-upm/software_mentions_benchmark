# Software Mentions Benchmark
This application is a benchmark to test different models of software mentions. It is composed by these scripts
* **softcite_converter**: Script to convert the softcite corpus written in TEI/XML format to somesci corpus format (BRAT + TXT). It will generate two files: a BRAT file with the annotations and a text file with the text without annotations.
* **eval_model**: Script to validate the somesci model using the softcite corpus. It will use the files generated by the softcite_converter. It will generate a summary.csv file with the true positives, false positives and false negatives of each file.
