All 454 reads were fi rst converted from fl owgrams to FASTA and FASTAqual fi les without 454 adapters, using the sff_extract software (http://bioinf. comav.upv.es/sff_extract/index.html). We found 398,286 sequence reads with an average read length of 274 bp from two independent runs. MSATCOM-MANDER software ( Faircloth, 2008) was used to identify perfect microsatellites containing at least fi ve repeat units for dinucleotides and four for tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanuclotides. Perfect microsatellite motifs were found in 10,685 (2.6%) reads, of which dinucleotide repeats were most abundant (62%), followed by trinucleotide repeats (31%), and tetranucleotide repeats (6%). Using Primer3 software ( Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000 ) embedded in the QDD software ( Meglécz et al., 2010 ), primer design was possible in 282 reads, with the following parameters: (1) melting temperatures 50-70 ° C, (2) PCR product between 90 and 320 bp, (3) GC content >40%, (4) primer length between 17 and 27 nucleotides, (5) primer self-complementarities and complement between them fulfi ll the quality criteria used as default parameters in the Primer3 software. Ensenada, Baja California (29.063 ° N, 114.155 ° W). Duplicate samples of each individual were stored in 96% ethanol at the Laboratorio de Genética para la Conservación at CIBNOR . PCR reactions were performed, as described above, using optimized primer-specifi c annealing temperatures ( Table 1 ), magnesium chloride, and forward-labeled primers (5 ′ end-labeled with FAM, NED, PET, and VIC; Applied Biosystems). Individuals were genotyped by assessing allele size on a genetic analyzer (model 310, Applied Biosystems), using the GeneScan 600 LIZ Size Standard (Applied Biosystems) and GeneMapper 4.1 software (Applied Biosystems).
Observed heterozygosity was estimated in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA). Expected heterozygosity was estimated in ATETRA software for tetraploid species that account for all possible combinations of allele copy numbers in populations with partial heterozygotes ( Van Puyvelde et al., 2010 ). Genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity varied from low to high across loci in both populations. Observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.13 to 0.78 (mean H o = 0.59) and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.37 to 0.77 (mean H e = 0.57) at El Comitán. At Punta Prieta, observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.03 to 0.85 (mean H o = 0.41) and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.03 to 0.72 (mean H e = 0.40) ( Table 2 ). For this study, we assumed tetraploidy in both populations because we observed as many as four alleles per locus in individual plants. Our results are also consistent with a tetrasomic pattern of inheritance previously suggested in P. pringlei , based on an allozymatic study ( Murawski et al., 1994) and a chromosome counting study ( Pinkava et al., 1973 ).
