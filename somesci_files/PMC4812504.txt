The primary antibodies used in this work have been used in previous studies and have been well characterized by our group and other authors regarding specific celltype immunostaining in whole fixed porcine eyes and in porcine neuroretina samples [6-8,16]. Furthermore, control samples in which primary antibodies were omitted were processed in parallel, and no immunoreactivity was found in any case. Samples were analyzed with a Leica DM4000BNeuroretina thickness quantification: The thickness of the neuroretina and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) were measured on toluidine blue histological images with Image J 1.47v (NIH Image, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Measurements were performed in representative serial sections. Neuroretina thickness was determined between the outer and the inner limiting membranes. In each case, six measurements were performed in 20X images from each of the neuroretina explants (n=20).
Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using R Statistical Software version 3.1.0 (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The means and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables. The statistical significance level was set at 5%.
A Kruskal one-way ANOVA (ANOVA) was used to compare the mean thicknesses of freshly isolated neuroretinas and those cultured for 9 days alone or for 9 days in coculture with RPE cells. The homogeneity of variance assumption was checked with the robust Brown-Forsythe Levene-type test using the group medians as implemented in R lawstat package [17]. When the homogeneity of variance was not validated, the Welch test was used for comparison of the mean values.
