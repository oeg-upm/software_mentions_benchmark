Data were analyzed using Stata statistical software (Ver. 11, College Station, TX, USA). Baseline characteristics are expressed as mean Â± standard deviation or percentage. Differences between measurements and groups were assessed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson chi-square tests. Age-and sexadjusted and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between dairy product and milk intake and MetS components. An additional multivariate model including age, sex, physical activity, alcohol consumption, total energy intake, smoking status, education, and income as covariates was used. The proportional hazards assumption was graphically assessed using log-log plots and statistically assessed on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals (15). No major violations of the proportional hazard assumption were detected. A two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
