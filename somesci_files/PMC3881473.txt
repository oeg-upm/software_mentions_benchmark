Conversion efficiency (%recovery 16)) was calculated using Formula 9. %recovery= (│Wy│+│Wz│-Wext) ⁄ (│Wy│+│Wz│) × 100 (9) %recovery is the rate of mutual exchange of the kinetic energy and potential energy of the COM in walking. Meaning the value of %recovery in walking with efficient use of gravity is high. The %recovery value was calculated for each phase shown in Fig. 1, and the averages of one whole gait cycle, and the stance phases of the paretic and the non-paretic sides were calculated. The data of gait speed, Power-y, Power-z, Power-ext of each phase, and %recovery, were compared among the three conditions of: gait with patients' own AFOs, with the PF-AFO at the first fitting, with the PF-AFO after continuous use. R 2.8.1 software was used for statistical analysis, and the Steel-Dwass method was applied. The level of significance was chosen as less than 5%.
