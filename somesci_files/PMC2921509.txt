Data are presented as mean + standard deviation. Statistical analyses for comparison groups employed one-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test performed with GraphPad prism software (version 4.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Tests were two-sided and adjusted for variance inequality where appropriate. Linear regression with Pearson's correlation test was used to determine the covariant relationships between data. Normal distribution of the data was confirmed by comparing against expected normal distributions with given means and standard deviation. In all cases, test probability values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Greater serum phosphate, creatinine, and cystatin C levels suggest that 5/6 nephrectomy induced kidney failure, which in turn promotes inflammation. 15 Osteogenic activity in mouse arteries and aortic valves associate with each other and increase with atherosclerosis severity
