Although technology can target the PWD themselves, the vast majority of telemedicine and smart technologies are designed to support family caregivers. Two separate systematic reviews highlight the benefits of web-based caregiver support programs. 29 Web-based training and educational programs to support caregivers are readily available. The InternetBased Savvy Caregiver, based on the validated Savvy Caregiver program, 30 is an example. It provides an interactive, iterative curriculum that improves knowledge about, and competence for, caregiving. 25 A customized computer-telephone integration system, e-care, provides a psychoeducational intervention that identifies resources and strategies to enhance safety, communication, selfcare, social support, and management of problem behaviors in the community. 31 The system features screen phones with hierarchal menus (text and voice) that enables users to 1) place and receive calls, 2) send and retrieve messages, 3) access a range of information and services, and 4) conference with several people simultaneously. This system was effective in decreasing caregiver burden and depression significantly in depression scores in caregivers with high depression scores at baseline. 31 Another type of in-home caregiver support links caregivers with expert guidance for managing challenging care situations using video monitoring. Caregivers are trained to capture behaviors that are a problem via computer video recording, which is then wirelessly uploaded for a team of experts to review and provide feedback. In a pilot study, this system demonstrated improved behavior management and caregiver communication and was reported as easy to use. 32 Support for caregivers can also be provided via web-based video conferencing and/or text-based chat forums. 33 There is growing use and acceptance of video conferencing in both the diagnosis and monitoring in geriatric medical 34 and geriatric psychiatry care. 35-37 Though further large-scale studies are needed, research has established the reliability and validity for neurocognitive testing and neurological examinations via video telemedicine. 35,37,38 Video conferencing can also link local primary care professionals to specialists for assessments, enhancing the administration of standardized assessments and examinations. 35,36 Telehealth diagnosis and monitoring have been welcomed in remote and rural areas and with Spanishspeaking and Native American populations, as access to specialized services is limited in these underserved areas. 39,40
