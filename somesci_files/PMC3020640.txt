Growth assays were performed as previously described (Zubko et al, 2004). Pooled colonies were inoculated into 2 ml of YEPD and grown to saturation at 231C. Five-fold serial dilutions were replicated onto agar plates and grown at a range of temperatures. Plates were photographed using an SPimager (S&P Robotics). Levels were adjusted with Photoshop CS4.
