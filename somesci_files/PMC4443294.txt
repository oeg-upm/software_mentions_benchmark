Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Hearts (n ¼ 2/group) were stopped with KCl, fixed in Zinc Fixative then embedded in paraffin. Next, they were cut cross-sectionally, stained in Hematoxylin and eosin or picosirus red (collagen), then viewed under polarized light. Livers from these animals were fixed, embedded and stained in a similar fashion, with the exception that oil red O was used for liver triglycerides. Images of each heart were captured at 20X. The cardiomyocyte diameter of 8e10 myocytes from 5 captured images per animal was analyzed using Image J (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) by an individual blinded to the treatment group.
The technique applied has been modified from methods previously described [96,97]. Briefly, w100 mg of cardiac tissue was excised and added to a petri dish with ice. The tissue was minced for 4e5 min, until it could pass through a pipette, and subjected to a brief (2 min) trypsin incubation. The mixture was transferred to a 50 mL conical tube and allowed to settle. The supernatant was removed and discarded. The remaining mixture was resuspended in 3 mL of Mitochondria Isolation Medium (MIM) (300 mM Sucrose, 10 mM Na-HEPES, 0.2 mM EDTA) with BSA, then transferred to a pre-chilled Dounce homogenizer and slowly homogenized for a total of w10e 12 counts. The homogenate was then subjected to a series of differential centrifugation steps. The fractions of isolated mitochondria obtained (mixed subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar) were resuspended in a small volume of MIM þ BSA and frozen at À80 for biochemical analysis.Membranes were incubated using infrared fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), scanned using Odyssey Clx Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) and analyzed by densitometry using Image J (NIH). The absolute quantities of GPx4 and HNE-modified protein adducts in human cardiac tissue was determined by a quantitative ELISA approach developed in our lab, as described previously [54].Portions of the labeled cardiac tissue homogenate were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel. The gels were scanned using Odyssey Clx Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor) and Cy5.5-labeled proteins were analyzed by densitometry using Image J (NIH).
All animal data are presented as mean AE SEM. Statistical analysis on mouse model variables were performed with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, Ca.). One way ANOVA was performed on continuous variables followed by NewmaneKeuls post test, with a < 0.05 considered statistically significant. In the human data analysis, categorical variables are presented as frequency and percentage and continuous variables were presented as mean AE standard deviation, mediation, median and interquartile range. Fisher exact and Chi (c 2 ) procedures were used to compute statistical significance of group comparisons for categorical variables. Deuchler-Wilcoxon was used for continuous variables. Biochemical variables were divided into quartiles (GPx4) or tertiles (HNE) and analyzed using a robust Poisson regression model (with relative risk as the measure of association). Missing values for all clinical and biochemical variable were imputed using the iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm as described in a recent study [94]. Variables that were statistically significant in the univariable analysis were included into the multivariable analysis. P-value was computed using Friedman's Nonparametric test for central tendency while adjusting for age. P trend was computed using likelihood ratio trend test, adjusting for age and sex. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. SAS Version 9.3 was used for all analyses of human biochemical and clinical variables.
