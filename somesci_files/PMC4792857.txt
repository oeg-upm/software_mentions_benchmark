A panel consisting of 25 microsatellite markers was selected for the diversity analysis of Tibetan sheep population. These were chosen from literature related with sheep diversity studies aiming to analyze highly polymorphic markers spread across the genome. These markers also adhere to the guidelines of International Society for Animal Genetics and FAO (http://dad.fao.org/en/refer/library/guidelin/marker.pdf). Detailed information on primers is presented in Table 1. Forward primer of each marker was 5′ labeled with fluorescent dye, i.e. FAM, NED, PET and VIC. PCR amplification was performed in a reaction volume of 25 μl on i-cycler. Reaction mixture consisted of 50-100 ng of genomic DNA, 200 μM of each dNTP, 50 pM of each primer and 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The amplification was carried out using a Touchdown program for all microsatellite loci, which consists of initial denaturation of 95°C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 60°C for 1 min, 3 cycle of 95°C for 45 s and 57°C for 1 min; 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 54°C for 1 min, 3 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 51°C for 1 min and 20 cycles of 95°C for 45 s and 48°C for 1 min. The PCR amplification was confirmed by electrophoresing the products in 1.8% agarose gel followed by staining with ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml). PCR products were multiplexed (Table 1) and genotyping was carried out on an automated ABI-3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA) using LIZ 500 as the internal size standard (Applied Biosystems, USA). Allele sizing was done using GeneMapper™ software v 3.7. Stutter related scoring error, often seen in dinucleotide repeats, was absent and alleles could be scored unambiguously.
