MTs (concentration measured as polymerized tubulin dimers) were incubated at 37°C with Tau protein for 15 min in PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid [EGTA]) supplemented with 10 μM Taxol. The MTs and associated Tau (and any other sedimentable assemblages) were pelleted out of solution at 23,000 × g for 20 min at 37°C. The supernatants containing free Tau were separated from the pellets, and the pellets were resuspended in PEM. Samples were mixed with SDS buffer, boiled, and run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Controls with Tau and MTs alone were included in each MT-binding assay. Background-corrected intensities of the bound and free fractions of the Coomassie Bluestained Tau protein bands were measured using Image J software. GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) was used for all curve fitting, as described below.
