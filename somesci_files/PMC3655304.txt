We performedFor localization of a region of interest (ROI), the T2 weighted fast spin-echo sequences in two different slice orientations were performed. Then, automated 1 H shimming was done to obtain the homogeneity of the ROI by using the point resolved spectroscopy sequence pulse sequence. For 31 P spectroscopy, the free induction decay (FID) 2 dimensional (2D) chemical shift imaging (CSI) sequence was carried out in an axial plane. The field of view was 3 x 3 x 3 cm, and the volume was 27 mL. The following parameters were used, Nex: 8, scan number: 128, spectral width: 2500 Hz, and acquired data points: 2048. The 31 P spectra were post-processed using an automated procedure developed in SAGE (GE Medical Systems, Fremont, CA, USA). The obtained FID signal was displayed as a spectrum, following 2D CSI reconstruction with a magnitude channel. After using the 6 Hz exponential line broadening, we obtained the MR spectra that were assigned on the basis of prior assignment, such as PME, Pi, PDE, PCr and ATP. The chemical shift in the 31 P MRS referred to the position of PCr (Î´ = 0.00 ppm). The intracelluar pH of the lesions was calculated by using the chemical shift of Pi relative to PCr, with the formula taken from Ng et al. (10) (Fig. 2). The integral of each of the phosphorous metabolites, such as ATP, PCr, Pi, PME and PDE, was measured. The following metabolite ratios of PME/PDE, PME/Pi, PDE/Pi, PME/ATP, PDE/ATP, PME/PCr, PDE/PCr, PCr/ATP, PCr/Pi and ATP/Pi were calculated from the measured values (Figs. 3-5).
A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. The statistical analysis was performed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (version 19.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
