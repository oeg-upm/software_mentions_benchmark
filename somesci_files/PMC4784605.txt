Electronic data entry was performed by a single investigator and independently verified by a second study team member against hard copies of the original data collection forms. The MM was applied to the quality assured data as previously described. 7 The MUAC and HL measures for each child were rounded up or down to the nearest 1.0 cm and the corresponding fractional weight for each measurement obtained from the published table. The fractional weights were summed to generate an estimated weight for that participant. Data on age, height, and MUAC were used to estimate weight using 12 other weight estimation methods: Advanced Pediatric Life Support (APLS), Best Guess, Broselow, Leffler, Luscombe-Owens, Nelson, Shann, Theron, Traub-Johnson, and TraubKichen. 8-19 The predicted weights as determined by each method were regressed against actual weights and the slope, the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the slope, the intercept, the 95% CI for the intercept, and the Pearson correlation coefficient were estimated. The percent agreement between estimated weight and actual weight was determined visually using Bland-Altman plots with log-transformation. Mean error (ME) was calculated by taking the difference of the predicted and actual weights. Mean percentage error (MPE) was calculated by dividing the actual weight into the ME and multiplying by 100. Root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated by taking the square root of the average squared error. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was determined using a 2-way random effects model and an absolute agreement definition to evaluate reliability between raters. All mathematical and statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel 2003 andSPSS v12.
