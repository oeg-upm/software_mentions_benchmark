Measles virus genotyping was performed at the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML), Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) on appropriate clinical specimens (respiratory specimens, urines, and viral isolates) collected from suspect measles cases. RNA was extracted using either the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen), or the MPLC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit -High Performance (Roche) automated on the MagNA Pure LC 2.0 (Roche). The World Health Organization (WHO) standardized genotyping region [14], and the 450 nucleotides encoding the carboxyl-terminus of the measles nucleoprotein was amplified by one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ([RT-PCR] OneStep RT-PCR kit; Qiagen). Amplicons were purified and sequenced by the Genomics Core Services section at the NML. Contigs were prepared using SeqMan Pro (DNASTAR) software. The resulting sequences were aligned with WHO genotype reference sequences [15] using MegAlign (DNASTAR) software and genotypes determined by highest homology.
