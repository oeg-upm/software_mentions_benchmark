1-3 uL of samples loaded in home-made gold-coated borosilicate capillaries were directly infused into an Exactive Plus Orbitrap instrument with extended mass range (EMR) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) using an m/z range of 500-10,000 Th. The voltage offsets on transport multi-poles and ion lenses were manually tuned to achieve optimal transmission of protein ions at elevated m/z. Nitrogen was infused in the higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) cell at a gas pressure of 6-8 ยฃ 10 ยก10 bar. MS parameters were adjusted as follows: spray voltage 1.2-1.3 V; source fragmentation 30 V; source temperature 250 C; collision energy 30 V; resolution (at m/z 200) 17,500. The instrument was mass-calibrated using CsI clusters, as described previously. 33 The raw mass spectra were deconvoluted using Protein Deconvolution v2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) andBioAnalyst v1.1 (AB/Sciex, Canada). The deconvoluted data were further processed as described previously to solve the composition of glycosylation and other possible PTMs. 29 Average MW values of individual carbohydrate residues used for MW calculation include: hexose/mannose/galactose (Hex/Man/Gal) -Targeted N-glycan profiling using nanoLC-Chip-Q-TOF MS N-glycans were released from the proteins before the analysis using a nanoLC-chip-Q-TOF MS system. The release, purification, injection, data acquisition and analysis of N-glycan were performed following the described previously protocols. 25 In brief, N-glycans were released from reduced mAb by PNGase F digestion, followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) purification, chemical reduction by NaBH 4 , and SPE again for the removal of reductant. Purified N-glycans were then loaded to Agilent nanoLC-chip-Q-TOF analyzed with the exact same condition of a previously reported human serum N-glycan structural library. A mixture of serum N-glycans standard was prepared and analyzed together with mAb N-glycans to calibrate chromatographic retention times in the serum N-glycan library as described previously. 34 Structures of N-glycan were identified by matching with accurate masses and calibrated chromatographic retention times from the library.
To compare the simulated result with the native MS spectra, the native MS spectra (acquired in profile mode) are pre-processed by convoluting the ESI spectrum to a zero-charge state spectrum using the Protein Deconvolution package (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Subsequently, the standard Pearson correlation is performed to evaluate the data generated from the 2 platforms.
