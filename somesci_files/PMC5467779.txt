Western blot assay. The cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer supplemented with RIPA 10 µl/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a protease inhibitor, and protein concentrations were determined by a Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein assay kit. All of these reagents were purchased from the Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), which were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 2 h before being incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4˚C. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The protein bands were visualized by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence Detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and photographed by a Gel Logic 2200 PRO imaging system. The following primary antibodies were used in this experiment: an MTDH rabbit mAbsiRNA interference and stable knockdown cell line establishment. Four siRNA sequences targeting human MTDH mRNA were designed using RNAi designer (Oligo 6.0 software). A scrambled sequence of targeting MTDH sequences was used as a negative control. The control siRNA (MTDH-con si) targeting sequence was 5'-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACG UTT-3', the MTDH-siRNA#1 (si#1) targeting sequence was 5'-GCUGUUCGAACACCUCAAATT-3', the MTDHsiRNA#2 (si#2) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCGUAAUCA ACCCUAUAUTT-3' , and the MTDH-siRNA#3 (si#3) targeting sequence was 5'-GCCAUCUGUAAUCUUAUCATT-3'. The most effective siRNA sequence was selected, after which a hairpin structure (shRNA) was added to it. A recombinant lentivirus containing the corresponding MTDH-shRNA construct was subsequently produced via co-transfection of 293T cells with helper plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2G) with Lipofier (HanBio, Shanghai, China). After 48 h of transfection, the cultured supernatant was harvested, filtered and concentrated by ultra centrifugation. To establish stable MTDH-knockdown cell lines, we transduced the MKN45 and AGS cell lines with lentiviral RNAi vectors. After 72 h, the cells were treated with 2 µg/ml puromycin. The puromycin-resistant clones were selected and expanded for subsequent experiments.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t-test wereperformed to determine significance, and Chi-square tests were used to compare clinical characteristics of patients between different groups. Overall survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by the log-rank test. All the analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 software and Prism statistical program 5, and all statistical tests were twosided. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
