Immunofluorescent labeling was conducted on frozen cortical brain sections of Htau (Jackson Laboratory, stock #004808, n = 3), and wildtype (WT) (Taconic, BALB/c, n = 2) mice as well as brain samples from FTLD (n = 4), AD (n = 4), and age-matched controls (n = 4) (Oregon Brain Bank). P301L (Taconic, stock #2508, n = 3) mouse eye sections were also used. Immunofluorescence was conducted as previously published [35]. Briefly, the sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton-X 100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and the human sections were treated with an autofluorescence eliminator as per manufacturer instructions (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Mouse and human sections were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and were then incubated with tau oligomerspecific polycolonal antibody T22 (mouse-1:250, human-1:200, [22]) in 4 • C overnight. The following day, the sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for 1 h. Sections were then incubated overnight with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (mouse and human-1:150, BioLegend, San Diego, CA), Iba1 (mouse and human-1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), or high motility group box 1 (HMGB1) (Mouse-1:50, Abcam, human-1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 • C. The sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa-568 (1:500, Invitrogen) or goat anti-rabbit 568 for 1 h. The sections were stained with 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen) and mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). The retinal slides were imaged with a confocal LSM510 Zeiss laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) as a single digital image. The brain sections were imaged on a Nikon A1R MP laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) at 60X magnification under oil submersion. The objective numerical aperture was 1.4. Using ImageJ, the corrected cell fluorescence method was used to quantify the images as previously described [35, 36]. Briefly, there were four separate images from each section analyzed using this method where five cells were measured as well as five background regions. In order to account for cell size and background, the background was multiplied by the area of the cell and subtracted from the total fluorescence. One-way ANOVA, student's t-tests, or Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the corrected cell fluorescence on Graphpad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA). In addition, Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured to quantify the strength of co-localization between T22 and GFAP using ImageJ software.
An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to detect the astrocyte marker, GFAP, and total tau. All measurements were performed in triplicate. Plates were coated with 30 g/well using 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, as coating buffer, followed by overnight incubation at 4 • C. Agematched control (n = 4), FTLD (n = 4), and AD (n = 4) brains obtained from the Oregon Brain bank, were used in the ELISA. Negative and positive controls were conducted. The positive control was Tg2576 insoluble brain homogenate with 0.05% Triton-X in PBS. Plates were washed 1 time with Tris-buffered saline with low Tween (0.01%) (TBST), then blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 10% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The plates were then washed with TBST 1 time. Anti-GFAP (1:2000, Covance, Princeton, NJ) was diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST and added to one plate. Anti-Tau5 (1:1000, Millipore), diluted in 5% nonfat milk in TBST, was added to another plate and all were allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed 3 times with TBST and 100 l of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:3000, BioRad, Hercules, CA) was added. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, plates were washed 3 times with TBST and developed with 3,3',5,5',-tetramethylbenzidine substrate from DAKO (Carpentaria, CA). The reaction was stopped with 100 l 1 M HCl, and samples were read at 450 nm using a POLARstar OMEGA plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Ortenberg, Germany). Oneway ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test was used to analyze results on GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software).
Images were quantified using corrected cell fluorescence, as described previously [35, 36]. Four images per subject were obtained and five cells were outlined and measured in each image. To account for both background and the size of the cell, five background measurements were also taken and the background fluorescence was multiplied by the area. This was subtracted from the total intensity for the cell in order to obtain a corrected cell fluorescence. The corrected cell fluorescence for five cells per image were averaged and a One-Way ANOVA with a multiple comparisons test was conducted to compare control (n = 4, 20 cells quantified), FTLD (n = 4, 20 cells quantified), and AD (n = 4, 20 cells quantified). A student's unpaired t-test was used for the mouse quantifications with two groups while a One-Way ANOVA was used for the mouse samples with more than two groups. For the ELISA, One-Way ANOVA was used with multiple comparisons test. All statistics were performed on GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
