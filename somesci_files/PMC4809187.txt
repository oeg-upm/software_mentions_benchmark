Demographics and clinical characteristics of participants are reported in frequency and proportions for categorical variables, and means and SDs for continuous variables. Gender difference in these variables was assessed using Fisher exact tests, Ï‡ 2 tests or two-sample t tests when appropriate. The same approach compared female participants between SUDDEN victims and total deceased in Wake County and in the living population of Wake County. EMS reports, clinical risk factors and cause of death on death certificate were compared between male and female SUDDEN subjects and reported as ORs with 95% CIs. Subgroup analysis, stratified by coronary disease as the cause of death, was conducted to explore the difference in death age between males and females. All of the analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute Inc). We consider twosided p value <0.05 statistically significant.
