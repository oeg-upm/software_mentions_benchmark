The Pt L 3 -edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) were obtained on the BL14W1 beamline at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), operated at 3.5 GeV with injection currents of 140-210 mA. A Si (111) double-crystal monochromator was used to reduce harmonic component of the monochrome beam. All the samples were measured in fluorescence mode. The powder of a sample was pressed into a self-supporting disk, which was then sealed with Kapton membrane and subjected to XAS measurement. The IFEFFIT software was used to calibrate the energy scale, to correct the background signal and to normalize the intensity. Reliable parameters for the Z (Pt, Pt) and Z (Pt, O) contributions were determined by multiple-shell fitting in r space with application of k 3 and k 1 weightings in the Fourier transformations.
DFT calculations of the charge density around proton H 1 in SAPO-CHA. Calculations were carried out using the CASTEP periodic density functional theory (DFT) package. The exchange-correlation energy and potential were described selfconsistently within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PW91). The selfconsistent PW91 density was determined by iterative diagonalization of the Kohn2Sham Hamiltonian. The wave functions were expanded with the plane wave, and the ultra-soft pseudo-potential method was used to reduce the number of plane waves. Plane waves were used as a basis set with an energy cutoff of 340 eV .The electron density was approximated using a multipolar expansion up to hexadecapole. Typical overbinding associated with local density functionals was rectified through the use of the gradient-corrected Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. The Brillouin-zone integration was performed using a 2 3 2 3 2 Monkhorst-Pack (MP) grid. The STM images were simulated using the Tersoff-Hamann approach with a bias voltage of 2 V.
