A power analysis was performed to ensure adequate power to detect differences between the WC patients who returned to work without restrictions and those who failed to do so. WC patients who returned to work without restrictions were compared with those who failed to do so. WC patients were also compared with controls. Comparative statistical analysis of continuous variables was performed utilizing independent samples paired and unpaired t-tests. An analysis of covariance was subsequently performed on post-operative outcome scores to ensure that the observed statistical effect was not influenced by pre-operative baseline values. Contingency analysis was carried out with chi-squared or Fisher's exact test for nominal variables. A P values of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant (SPSS Version 21, Chicago, IL).
