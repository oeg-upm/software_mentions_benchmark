We evaluated the prediction power of sCD163 plus ALT by calculating the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curves. We randomly partitioned the sample into two halfsamples, each containing 50% of the cases (Group 3) and 50% of controls (Group 2). The first-half sample was used as the training set on which we fitted a logistic regression model and estimated the coefficients on sCD163 and ALT. 26 We used the second half-sample as the validation set and calculated the ROC curve of the score based on the coefficients estimated from the training set. We calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for both the training and validation sets. The software SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) were used for the analyses. P values o0.05 were considered significant.
