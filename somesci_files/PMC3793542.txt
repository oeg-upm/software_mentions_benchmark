Data analysis was performed with the help of the medical statistics department in our centre (HP), making use of SPSS release V.18.0 . Frequencies were used to estimate the prevalence of inquiring about the different domains of the pelvic floor. Bivariate associations between the groups and the types of answers were calculated using the Pearson Ï‡2 procedure; two-sided p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Some questions with more than one possible answer, and with open answers, were grouped together for analysis. In The Netherlands, ethical approval is not required for questionnaires of this kind.
