The signal intensity of lacritin bands was determined by multiplying the area of the band with the average pixel intensity to provide volume-sum intensity for each band. The signal intensity of the 12-to 15-kDa, 25-kDa, and 40-kDa bands from each individual's tear sample was quantified using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij: provided in the public domain by theNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The signal intensity value of each band was expressed as area pixel density. Data were expressed as the relative percentage of lacritin species by dividing the signal intensity of each lacritin species (i.e., lacritin cleaved fragment [15 kDa], lacritin monomer [26 kDa], or inactive lacritin polymers >40 kDa) by the total signal intensity of all lacritin species.
Images of corneal nerves were collected using the Nidek Confoscan 4 (Nidek Technologies, Fremont, CA, USA) in vivo scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 340 lens. Images were obtained from the epithelial to endothelial surface of the central cornea (460 3 345 lm). To maintain masking, each set of images was renamed before selecting the series of frames that corresponded to the subepithelial compartment and contained images of the subbasal nerve plexus. Three trained observers assessed four parameters of nerve morphology: nerve fiber density (NFD), nerve fiber length (NFL), nerve branch density (NBD), and tortuosity using CC Metrics, a semiautomated nerve analysis program developed by Rayaz Malik, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.
All analyses are based on readouts obtained from single eyes randomly chosen from each patient. Demographic variables, tear lacritin levels, corneal nerve morphology, and clinical measures of ocular surface disease (i.e., OSDI, Schirmer, OSS, TBUT, and CST) were compared between SS and age-matched controls. Group differences in sex and ethnicity were tested by Fisher's exact test; Schirmer score, OSDI, OSS, CST, TBUT, percent expression of tear lacritin isoforms, and features of nerve fiber morphology were examined by Wilcoxon exact test. Differences in age and total tear lacritin assessed by ELISA were compared by t-test. Correlations among variables were assessed by Spearman correlation and reported as correlation coefficients along with their corresponding P values to provide information on the strength and reliability of the correlation, respectively. 18 Of these measures, integer and continuous variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation (SD), categorical and binary variables as the accounted number of subjects. Western blot data were normalized by the three-component sum of lacritin species for each sample 19 ; then normalized values were presented as percentages. Performance of clinical readouts and lacritin-based tear measurements as diagnostic parameters to identify patients with the ocular component of SS was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using the RStudio platform (Boston, MA, USA), version 0.98.1102. Area under the curve (AUC) was estimated by R package pROC to determine the 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). 20 The ROC cutoff for each of these variables was optimized to maximize the sensitivity and specificity. The optimized performances were compared to the performance of clinical tests and associated cutoffs currently used to diagnose the signs and symptoms of SSassociated dry eye, including Schirmer score 5, OSS ‡ 3, OSDI ‡ 20, and TBUT < 10 seconds. The mean values and 95% confidence intervals of sensitivity and specificity for each clinical test were calculated from 2000 bootstrap runs using the R package Boot. 21
