During the first improvement cycle, the team used several strategies to establish the internal and external validity of automated data collection. Our automated data collection method used the VistA database query utility to identify all enoxaparin, subcutaneous heparin and warfarin orders for patients meeting inclusion criteria. For patients with contraindications to anticoagulation, we queried charts for documentation of a contraindication and an order for compression devices. To establish the internal validity of ourTo measure a potential relationship between use of the new menu and change in facility performance, we applied Pearson's correlation between the proportion of cases with recommended prophylaxis ordered and the use of the new order menu. All statistics were performed using SPSS version 14.0.
