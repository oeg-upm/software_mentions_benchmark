Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted from tissues using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.), treated with DNase I (RNase-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and reversely transcribed into cDNA with random hexamers using the SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Primers for each mRNA were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) based on sequence data from GenBankTM (Table S1 and ref. 38) and were validated as described 39. Real-time PCR reactions contained 10-25 ng cDNA, 150 nM of each primer, and 5 ml 2X-Jump Start SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Sigma) in 10 ml total volume. PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7900 HT instrument. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using either the comparative C T or standard curve methods normalized to cyclophilin mRNA or 18S RNA, respectively.
