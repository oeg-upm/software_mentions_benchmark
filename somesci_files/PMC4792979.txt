The present study consisted of 16 elite Korean wrestling athletes and 95 nonathletes. Measurements were performed from March 2015 to August 2015. One hundred and eleven volunteers who had no abnormal physical or psychological conditions provided written informed consent to participation in this study 9). Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire via individual in-depth interviews, which took 30 minutes per person 9). There were seven weight categories: gyungjang (less than 75 kg), sojang (less than 80 kg), chungjang (less than 85 kg), yongjang (less than 90 kg), yongsa (less than 95 kg), yeoksa (less than 110 kg), and jangsa (less than 150 kg) 9, 10) . The criteria for the inclusion of participants in the study were as follows: (1) 20-23 years of age, (2) male, (3) history of respiratory disease, (4) experience of stress during exercise, (5) psychological factors, (6) history of injuries, and (7) primary technology used. Before measurement, all participants rested for 30 minutes 9) . Chest and abdominal circumference were measured at rest under expiratory and inspiratory conditions 2) . Chest circumference was measured at the height of the axilla, and abdominal circumference was measured at the height of the navel. The respiration ability of participants was measured. The participants were measured by lung function testing using the SCHILLER SP-260 spirometer (SCHILLER AG, Baar, Switzerland). Spirometric parameters, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow (PEF), peak inspiratory flow (PIF), slow vital capacity (SVC), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve volume (ERV), tidal volume (TV), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), minute or expired ventilation (MV), and respiratory rate (RR) were recorded and analyzed by methods of resting breathing and forced breathing. Measurement was focused on the FVC graph, which was divided into the expiratory area (ExA) and the inspiratory area (InsA) 2) . The pixel values were measured using Adobe Photoshop 7.0.1. The ExA was divided into A and B sections based on the PEF. Analogously, the InsA was divided into C and D sections based on the PIF. Each A, B, C, and D section was further subdivided to four areas Fig. 1A). From left to right, the connections between each of the divided points of the A area were designated as the first slope (AS1), the second slope (AS2), and the third slope (AS3). Correspondingly, from left to right, the first, second, and third slopes defining the B area were designated BS1, BS2, and BS3, respectively; the first, second, and third slopes defining the C area were designated CS1, CS2, and CS3, respectively; and the first, second, and third slopes defining the D area were designated DS1, DS2, and DS3, respectively Fig. 1A) 2) . After creating these subdivisions, the tangent and angle of each point were measured. The angle of each point and the respiratory area of the FVC were each measured in triplicate at each measurement time, and the mean values were calculated 2, 19). The formula for the tangent is given in Equation 1, where r is the radius of a circle composed of the coordinates of the x and y axes. The cos θ is the value obtained by dividing x by r; sin θ is the value obtained by dividing y by r. The tan θ is equivalent to the ratio of the sin θ to the cos θ 2, 20).
The IBM SPSS Statistics software (Version 22.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. The significance level was set to α=0.05, and all data are presented as the mean ± standard error (SE) of the measurements. One-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the significance between the groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient test was performed to identify correlations between the variables. The protocol for this study was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research of Yong In University in accordance with the terms of Resolution 5-1-20. Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the Korean wrestling athletes compared with those of the nonathletes. Spirometry parameters in the athletes group were significantly higher than in the nonathletes, but not ERV, IRV, and MVV Table 2). Respirogram phasic analysis revealed that the expiratory (ExA) and total area (Total) of the FVC were significantly increased in the athletes compared with the nonathletes Table 3 and Fig. 1B). The slopes of respirogram phases, such as the tangent angles, of the FVC were compared between nonathletes and athletes Table 3, Fig. 1B). The tangents for athletes at slopes 1, 2, and 3 of the A area (AS1, AS2, and AS3) were significantly increased Table 3, Fig. 1B). Furthermore, in the correlative analysis, chest and abdominal circumference were not correlated with the area of the FVC Table 4). The correlation coefficients for the chest circumference and tangent are shown in Table 5, with slope 3 of the A area (AS3) showing significant correlation.
