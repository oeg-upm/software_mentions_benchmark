The reported estimate and adjusted OR for closure time were calculated for an increase in platelet closure time of 10 s (rather than 1 s), a choice based on the premise that a 1 s increase would be of limited clinical usefulness. The final model was evaluated by c-statistic (area under the ROC curve) and the Hosmer and Lemeshow fit test. As a sensitivity test, the results were calculated using the general estimating equation (PROC GENMOD) with study site evaluated as a subject factor (cluster) rather than a term in the model. The Net Reclassification Index (NRI) and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) statistic were not included in the analyses, given the scepticism and criticisms that have been raised concerning their value in predicting the potential, incremental prognostic impact of novel biomarkers. 27 28 Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V.5.04 (San Diego, California, USA) and SAS V.9.3 (Carey, North Carolina, USA).
