Continuous data are presented as mean AE standard deviation (if normally distributed) and dichotomous data are presented as frequencies and percentages. Comparisons of continuous and dichotomous data between patient groups were performed using the Student's t-test and Ï‡ 2 test, respectively. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered significant. Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify the variables associated with the primary endpoint. Variables with a significant P-value on univariable analysis were entered in the multivariable model using the enter method. In addition, AV node ablation performed in patients with atrial fibrillationand low biventricular pacing rate was included as timedependent co-variate. The hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. All analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows, version 23.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics. The mean age was 66.1 AE 9.8 years, the majority of the population was male (76%), and ischaemic cardiomyopathy was the underlying cause of heart failure in 59% of the patients. NYHA functional class III or IV was reported by 697 patients (74%), and mean LVEF was 26 AE 8%. The majority of patients (n = 924; 95%) received a CRT device with defibrillator capabilities.
