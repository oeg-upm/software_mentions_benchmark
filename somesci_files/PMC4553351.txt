The differences in prevalence of bony labyrinth and cranial base defects between facial paralysis patients and nonfacial paralysis patients were examined using the Fisher exact test. Differences in facial canal dehiscence size between facial paralysis patients and nonfacial paralysis patients were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. GraphPad InStat 3 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SPSS ver. 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) were used for the statistical analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chungnam National University Hospital.
