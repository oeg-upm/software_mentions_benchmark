Saliva samples were separated on precast 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels (Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA). The membranes were immunoblotted with a primary antibody against human statherin (1:2000 dilution; STATH Polyclonal Antibody [catalog #19724-1-AP], Proteintech, IL, USA) at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (1:10,000) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, PA, USA). The statherin immunoreactive band was visualized using an ECL detection kit (ECL Advance™ Western Blotting Detection Kit, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and band images were acquired and analyzed with an AutoChemisystem (UVP, Inc., CA, USA). Gray-scale values for statherinpositive bands were quantified using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation, MD, USA).
A power analysis was performed using the statistical software, G*Power (version 3.1.9.2) [8,9] to determine the appropriate number of subjects to include in the study. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for comparing data from control and diabetic subjects. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used for the test of correlation between statherin level and HbA1c and blood glucose levels. These statistical analyses were carried out using PASW Statistics 17.0 software (SPSS, Inc., IL, USA). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
