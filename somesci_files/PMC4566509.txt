A set of primers to amplify a 384 bp fragment of β-giardin gene of G. intestinalis was amplified using the forward primer (5ʹ CAT AAC GAC GCC ATC GCG GCT CTC AGG AA 3ʹ) and the reverse primer (5ʹ GAG GCC GCC CTG GAT CTT CGA GAC GAC 3ʹ) as previously described [14]. The primers were designed based from the complete β-giardin gene of the Port-tive β-giardin gene from 3 fecal samples and a positive control were submitted for sequencing (Fig. 1). The DNA sequences were searched using BLASTN search algorithms (http://www. ncbi.nml.nih.gov/blast/) Table 2) and aligned using CLUSTAL W2 software (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) (Fig. 2).
