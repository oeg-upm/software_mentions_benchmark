Design algorithm shown in Fig. 6 is implemented in MAT-LAB code, where an initial case is chosen corresponding to ten z positions of points with cavity curvature is described with spline curve (step 2). Then the spline interpolated curve is sampled at 100 points, where those sampled points are considered connected with piecewise linear, approximating the cavity curvature. This piece wise linear description is fed to AUTO- MESH program to generate mesh (step 3). The solution of lowest TM mode of the cavity is made at step 4 by calling SUPERFISH, and the obtained frequency in step 5 is used to scale the cavity dimensions to keep the resonance frequency at 9.4 GH (step 6). The corresponding scaling is reflected on the obtained cavity shunt impedance (step 7), where this value is fed to the optimizer algorithm to determine the new ten points positions. Then the process is repeated starting from step 2.
