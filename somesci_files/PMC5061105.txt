Signal simulations were performed using extended phase graphs (8), including gradient de-phasing as well as radiofrequency pulses and signal evolution. The pattern recognition reconstruction was implemented following (2). All code for simulation and pattern recognition was written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). The dictionary contained values of T1 ranging from 80 ms to 1000 ms in steps of 20 ms, and from 1 to 2.5 s in steps of 50 ms. Values of T2 ranged from 10 ms to 100 ms in steps of 2 ms and from 105 ms to 250 ms in steps of 5 ms. B1 was modelled by a flip-angle factor, a linear factor equal to the obtained flip angle divided by the desired flip angle. Values for this parameter were simulated from 50 to 150% in 2% increments.
