On days 1 and 5, RNA from the incubated hepatocytes in the hybrid systems with different serum concentrations was extracted from the cell lysates by using the TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) suspended in distilled water; later, the RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA. Then, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed, and the products were analyzed by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and scanned by using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 8600 Imager. The relative intensities of the target genes (the genes for albumin, hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha [HNF-4Î±], and ASGPR) were calculated with ImageJ image analysis software (Version 1.48) and were compared to a housekeeping marker, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The level of expression of these genes in cells on gelatin surfaces with 10% FBS served as a control.
