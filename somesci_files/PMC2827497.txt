METHODS -This is a retrospective (Institutional Review Board approved) analysis of 810 days of CSII and CGM data from nine youth with diabetes. All subjects used the Minimed Paradigm REAL Time System (Northridge, CA) for insulin delivery and CGM. Reports were downloaded using Medtronic CareLink software. Afternoon snacks were identified on CGM as glucose excursions beginning between 1330 and 1700 h. A glucose excursion was considered resolved when glucose levels remained steady for Ն15 min. Glucose excursions with incomplete CGM data or CSII suspension Ͼ15 min were discarded. Glucose excursions were identified as a snack with no insulin (SNI) or a snack with insulin (SWI) as described below, and possible snacks not fitting these criteria were excluded from analysis. SNI criteria were as follows: 1) no bolus administered within Ϯ30 min of the beginning of the glucose excursion, 2) increase in glucose level Ն50 mg/dl, 3) average rate of change from baseline to peak of excursion Ն0.8 mg/dl per minute, 4) starting glucose level Ͼ80 mg/dl (to exclude treatment of hypoglycemia), and 5) determined not to be the dinner meal. Carbohydrate contents for snacks are not known for SNI.
