Statistical analysis was performed using statistical packageSPSS 21.0. Descriptive statistics were calculated. To determine whether there were differences between the transfemoral and transtibial amputee groups in terms of distribution by gender and walking with crutches the Chi-square test or Fisher Exact test were used. T-test or Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test was used for comparison of differences on PCI and CWS between two amputation groups. The one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison of differences between amputation groups and impact of using crutches on PCI and CWS.
