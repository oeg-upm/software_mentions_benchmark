Since D(1) is the lower triangular, the long-run multipliers from Aot, AYt, Art7, and it -n to Aht are zero, so the coefficients of their lags each sum to zero. Imposing these constraints yieldsThe variables considered in our model are total hours worked (ht), output (yt), inflation (rr,), the nominal interest rate (it), and real oil prices (or). The Appendix gives the details of the sources of the data. Estimates reported in this paper are based on quarterly U.S. data from 1951:1. Data before 1951 are used as initial conditions in autoregressions. The end of the sample period is discussed below. The data for labor hours, output, and price are for the nonfarm private economy, excluding housing. We choose output for the nonfarm, non-housing private sector, rather than the whole economy because there are serious conceptual difficulties in relating the output to the inputs of housing, government, and farms. Housing and government are imputed in the national accounts. Farmers are largely 12. In the RATS packages, the equations can be estimated without including the disturbances and then transformed via the standard Cholesky decomposition. This decomposition picks out a different linear combination of the aggregate demand shocks, but since only their joint effect is identified, this difference is inessential. 13. Blanchard and Quah (1988) use a different technique to estimate models subject to these long-run Wold causal orderings. They estimate the unrestricted vector autoregression for X, and then transform the system by post-multiplying the VAR by a matrix that imposes the necessary restrictions on the long-run multipliers and the residual covariance matrix.
