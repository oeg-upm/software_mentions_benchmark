One strategy that I pursue is to recruit undergraduate research assistants prior to their arrival at Cornell. I read through the folders of the students who have accepted offers of admissions to my college (approximately 160) and search for students with strong mathematics, statistics, or economics backgrounds. This usually means students who have taken calculus and/or either advanced-placement economics or advanced-placement statistics in high school. 4 I write several of these students prior to their arriving at Cornell and offer them positions as research assistants at CHERI. Given the large fraction of our students who must take out loans or work as part of their financial-aid packages, the take-up rate on these offers is high. 5 The current generation of entering first-year students is so computer-literate that they rapidly learn how to use spreadsheet and statistical software programs, such as EXCEL, Stat/Transfer, and STATA. I heuristically explain the econometric models we are using to them, and even if they have not had classes in statistics, they quickly understand the research that I am conducting. Within a short time, we are working together on empirical research projects. These students also mention our work to their friends, and I often link up with other bright students through these referrals.
