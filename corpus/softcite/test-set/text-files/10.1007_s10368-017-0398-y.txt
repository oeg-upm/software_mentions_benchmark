Generally, in practical applications the system matrices A and B together with the variances R and Q are unknown and have to be estimated. Whenever the explanatory variables are not observable Least Squares estimation is not the correct way to go. However, even in this case, one can apply likelihood based inference, since the Kalman filter allows to construct the likelihood function associated with a state space model. The SSM is therefore estimated by maximizing the estimated likelihood function through a numerical procedure. We apply this procedure by using the Sspace package in the EViews® software.
Compared to other approaches in the literature reviewed in section 3, the novel contribution of our methodology is that the deviation ratio measures a purely irrational bubble component. In other words, our bubble component does not include price changes that are due to non-equilibrium between supply and demand, where demand includes not only the users' market but also investors' demand. This feature is important because real estate markets can be characterized by a fundamental mismatch between supply and demand which can take time to correct and by a component of demand that is investment driven and that is typically not decreasing in price. 1 A fair account of the bubble component should therefore exclude those components. Moreover, in our analysis we do not consider rents on purpose, because those are codetermined in the economy with the observable market prices, whereas we want to have a measure of the fundamental unobservable real estate price that depends as much as possible on fundamental macro-economic factors.As it is often the case with this type of macro variables, evaluating the data with Augment Dickey-Fuller test reveals that these variables are non-stationary in levels, but become stationary in first differences. We also adjust for seasonality with the Eviews Census X12 method and take the log of all variables to correct for heteroscedasticity. SS is our measure for real estate demand and FS is our measure for real estate supply. We carry out Johansen tests to select co-integrated variables for demand and supply. After that we estimate the two functions by a SSM.
The residuals of the above five equations are assumed to have independent and identical distributions. Equations (3) and (4) form a SSM are estimated by Kalman filter using the Sspace analysis tools in Eviews 7.0®. The estimated coefficients represent the long term and stable elasticity of sold real estate space with respect to each variables. Results are reported in Table 2 below.
In this case, eqs. (5) and (6) form a SSM are estimated by Kalman filter using the Sspace analysis tools in Eviews 7.0®. The estimated coefficients represent the long term and stable elasticity of completed real estate space with respect to each variable. Results are reported in Table 4 below.
