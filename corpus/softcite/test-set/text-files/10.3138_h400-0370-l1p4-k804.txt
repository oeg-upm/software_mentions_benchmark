Analysis of the findings was ongoing throughout the data-collection period. This allowed emergent issues to be probed during subsequent interviews and to inform the sampling of additional informants.Sampling continued until saturation with regard to the contextual factors was reached. Each transcript was then thoroughly reviewed by the first author to reveal common themes. These themes were coded using NVivo qualitative analysis software. Some of the themes were directly related to the interview questions and others emerged from the interviews. The richness of the diversity of factors raised by respondents and their concurrence about the importance of these factors prompted a return to the literature to further assess the salience of these issues. It also led directly to thinking about how to place the diversity of factors into a coherent framework that would be helpful to policymakers and health-care providers interested in developing successful interdisciplinary collaborative mental healthcare programs. The conceptual framework presented here should be considered a starting point for further development. Figure 1 presents the conceptual framework that emerged from this analysis. The meaning of each factor within the framework is detailed in Table 1.
