The administrative data in PASS-ADIAB, whose structure is identical to that of the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB, see Antoni et al. 2016), consist of a number of files. The main file is the individual file that contains the longitudinal labour market biographies of all linked respondents. In order to use the linked administrative data they have to be merged to the individual interviews from the PASS SUF prior to analysis. To do so, one merges records that belong to the same person identifier pnr, which is contained in the survey datasets as well as in the administrative individual file. This is also shown in the User Guide: the procedure applicable to administrative data is similar to using PASS's own biography dataset (Stata: ibid, Example 9.4; SPSS: Fuchs et al. 2015, Example 1.4).
