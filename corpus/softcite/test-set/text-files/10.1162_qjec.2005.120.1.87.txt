The journal is hosted on an open-access, open-review, rapid publication platform called PubPub, created by students at the Media Lab. PubPub is a collaborative publication environment with rich commenting features, and powerful, intuitive authoring tools. JoDS articles are authored directly within the PubPub environment, which provides support for multimedia, image integration, and large data sets.
