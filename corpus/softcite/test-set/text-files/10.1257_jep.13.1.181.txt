In the 1995 Microsoft case, the Justice Department was seeking to protect competition in innovation as much as price competition. Protecting incentives for innovation is a common recent theme at the antitrust enforcement agencies. Another example occurred when two pharmaceutical producers, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, sought to merge in 1996. The FTC obtained a consent settlement requiring the merged firm (Novartis) to sell off one of the competing research and development efforts in genetic engineering to a third firm to protect competition in innovation. Moreover, in a new round of Microsoft litigation, the Justice Department is currently asking a court to determine whether Microsoft's integration of Internet browser software into Windows harms innovation and tends to create or maintain monopoly by excluding rivals selling browsers such as Netscape (DOJ's view), or promotes innovation and competition by improving software design (Microsoft's position). 6 The widely discussed possibility of network externalities-the benefit that users obtain when other customers use the same product, as with much computer software-raises the stakes for antitrust enforcers in discriminating between harmful and beneficial exclusionary practices. 7 The possibility of network effects increases the efficiency benefits of having a single standard in the marketplace, but it may also entrench a firm and so allow it to exercise market power in a more damaging way. In consequence, antitrust enforcement decisions may be ineffective unless they are made early in an industry's development, before a standard becomes so secure as to make an antitrust remedy impractical. Yet it may be hard to make reliable judgments before uncertainties about the consequences of the challenged conduct have been fully resolved in the marketplace.
