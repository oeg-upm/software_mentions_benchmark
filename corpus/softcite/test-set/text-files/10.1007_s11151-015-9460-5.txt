The difference in pricing strategies that characterizes two-sided markets warrants in many instances a different antitrust treatment. A recent review discussing these issues is Evans and Schmalensee (2015). Parker and Alstyne (2005) were among the first to present an economic model that highlights that in two-sided markets pricing below marginal cost on one side may be a (nonstrategic) profit-maximising strategy. Indeed, by pricing below marginal cost on one side of the market a firm increases sales on that side, thus boosting demand and profits on the other side. Wright (2004) included the claim that ''price below marginal cost on one side of the market is a sign of predation'' among the eight fallacies that derive from applying a one-sided logic to two-sided markets. 8 Despite the warnings of the economics literature, competition authorities and courts tend to analyse predatory claims with a one-sided logic. In the recent case Bottin Cartographes versus Google, 9 for instance, the Commercial Court of Paris 6 One can also express the price level in terms of advertising pages. In that case it is the sum of the advertising price and the circulation revenues per-advertising-page. 7 Note that such a ratio is equivalent to the ratio between the revenues from the two sides. In the newspapers' business the ratio of circulation revenues to advertising revenues (or vice versa) is sometimes called the 'financing mix'. 8 To our knowledge, no paper discusses the conditions for predation in prices to take place in a two-sided market. A partial exception is Motta and Vasconcelos (2012) who present a model of platform competition in which below-cost pricing can be used to deter the entry of a more efficient rival. However, the result in Motta and Vasconcelos (2012) found Google guilty of the abuse of a dominant position in the market for online maps that allow stores' geolocation. 10 The Court reached its decision by simply considering that the price of Google Maps API, being equal to 0 €, was necessarily lower than the production costs of the service. Interestingly, the Court stopped just short of recognizing the implications for competition policy of the two-sided business strategy of Google, as it recognized that Google, according to the contracts, would be able to insert advertising in its Google Maps API service and therefore sell targeted advertising.
Footnote 9 continued that provide stores' geolocation on firms' websites. Bottin is a multimedia mapping company that provides, among other things, online map applications that allow users to locate addresses and create itineraries online, which compete in France with the equivalent service of Google Maps API (Application Programming Interface). While Bottin offers its service in exchange for an annual fee and an ex post compensation based on actual consumption, the ordinary version of Google Maps API is provided to its customers on a free basis. Bottin claimed that this had to be considered a predatory pricing and that by doing so Google aimed to extend its dominant position in the market of online search to the connected relevant market. 10 More precisely, with its decision of 31 January 2012 the Commercial Court of Paris found Google guilty of the abuse of a dominant position pursuant to Article L-420-2 paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code and, as a consequence, awarded Bottin 500,000 € damages and interests, in addition to ordering Google to publish the judgment at its expense in several French and international newspapers. 11 Bottin Cartographes v. Google France and Google Inc. Court of Appeal of Paris, 5th Pole, 5th Chamber, 20 November 2013, available on http://www.legalis.net/spip.php?page=jurisprudencedecision&id_article=3942. 12 The opinion of the Competition Authority has not been made public yet. In fact, it can be disclosed only after the ruling of the Appeal Court (art. L.462-3 of the French Code of Commerce), which has not been handed out yet. Filistrucchi et al. (2013) point out that there exist two-types of two-sided markets. Two-sided non-transaction markets are characterized by the absence of a transaction between the two sides of the market and, even though an interaction is present, it is usually not observable, so that a per-transaction (or per-interaction) fee or a two-part tariff is not possible. Typical examples are media markets. Two-sided transaction markets are instead characterized by the presence and observability of a transaction between the two groups of platform users. As a result, the platform is able to charge not only a price for joining the platform, but also one for using it, i.e. it can ask a two-part tariff. Examples in this category include payment cards schemes, virtual marketplaces, auction houses and operating systems.
