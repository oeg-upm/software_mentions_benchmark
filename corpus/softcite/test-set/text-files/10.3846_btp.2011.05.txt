Mystery shopping started back in the 1940s with financial institutions. A shopper would enter the banking establishment, make a cash deposit, and state that a receipt was not needed. Observations of how the transaction was processed or not processed were made. This type of assignment is called an integrity assignment and mainly deals with the potential act of theft. From this type of assignment, mystery shopping has developed into a rather large and unique industry covering areas from auto repair to fast food. In fact, some fast-food restaurants are mystery-shopped three times a day and shoppers are rotated (Newhouse 2004: 2). Mystery shopping got its start as a way to check on employee integrity and minimize theft primarily in the financial services industry. In the 1990's, fuelled by the internet, the mystery shopping industry experienced rapid growth and acceptance. Into the 2000's, the creation of software packages such as SASSIE and Prophet have revolutionized the industry (Michelson 1997, 2004: 6).
