where ρ(j ) is Spearman's rho for a copula applicable in regime j. The predicted values of the lower and upper tail dependence coefficients are defined analogously. It follows from (8) that the ρ t is Spearman's rho for the mixture of copulas governingthe dependence in regimes 1 and 2, with the weights equal to the predicted probabilities P (S t = 1| t −1 ) and P (S t = 2| t −1 ). Formulas (12) and (13) imply that an analogous property holds for the lower and upper tail dependence coefficients. Our comparison of the mean values of the mentioned dependence measures taken in the subperiods of equal length uses the model confidence set (MCS) methodology. The ranking of the periods according to the mean value of Spearman's rho is obtained with the MCS procedure applied sequentially-after each run, the series constituting the MCS are excluded. The higher score means the stronger dependence. In the case where the MCS consists of at least two periods, the arithmetic mean of the corresponding scores is assigned to each of them. The same procedure is conducted for the series of the predicted values of tail dependence coefficients. All MCSs (with the significance level α = 0.1) have been estimated using the package MulCom of Hansen and Lunde (2010) written in Ox (Doornik 2006).
