Standard survival/duration models assume that the probability of eventual failure is greater than zero for all individuals (Boag 1949; Forster and Jones 2001; Schmidt and Witte 1989). Given that a large proportion of individuals never start smoking, we also used discrete time split population models. 4 All models were estimated using Stata/MP 14.1 with sampling weights. Split population models were estimated using spsurv developed by Jenkins without sampling weights. 5 Finally, we conducted a number of sensitivity checks to ensure that our main results were not sensitive to alternative specifications. 4. A number of studies have used a split population approach to examine the effect of prices on smoking onset. See for example, Douglas and Hariharan (1994), Douglas (1998), Forster and Jones (2001), López Nicolás (2002), Kidd and Hopkins (2004), Madden (2007), and Guindon (2014a).
