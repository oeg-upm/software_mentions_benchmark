Several tools can be used to potentially produce more precise economic impact estimates including the Regional Input-Output Multiplier System (RIMS II) provided by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and IMpact for PLANning (IMPLAN), a commercially available software package. Both models use input-output tables for specific industries grounded in interindustry relationships within regions based upon an economic area's normal production patterns. But as Matheson (2009) notes: "During an event like the Olympics, however, the economy within a region may be anything but normal, and therefore, these same inter-industry relationships may not hold. Since there is no reason to believe that the usual economic multipliers are the same during mega-events, any economic analyses based upon these multipliers may, therefore, be highly inaccurate."
