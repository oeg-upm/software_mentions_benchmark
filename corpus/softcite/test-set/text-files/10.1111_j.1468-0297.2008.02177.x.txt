(a) a transition probability equal to the squared demand for the rule of law:Figure 5(a) shows that the stable equilibria of x* are 0 and 0.75. In the first case, no one opposes the establishment of the rule of law, and reform occurs in period 1. In the second case, three-fourths of the agents oppose the rule of law, and reform is delayed on average for 16 periods. 24 Figure 5(b) depicts the growth paths of agentsÕ expected aggregate lifetime income in these two cases. 25 Expected aggregate income is 20% lower along the path of delayed reform. Every agent is strictly worse off. 20 As emphasised by Greif (1994), culture is an equilibrium selection device and so it is interesting to consider within this model the role that culture might have played in Russia. Two facts suggest that the ÔgoodÕ corner equilibrium, with x Ã ¼ 0, would not be a focal point: (a) managers commonly engaged in asset stripping well before the mass privatisation of 1992-4 (Grigoriev, 1992) and (b) most beneficiaries of the mass privatisation of large state enterprises in Russia were the managers. For instance, Varese (2001, Appendix B), finds in his survey of one Russian city in 1993 that 51% of the 92 full-time officials of the Communist Party in 1988 were top managers of economic enterprises. 21 We discuss other comparative statics results in Hoff and Stiglitz (2004a). 22 Or, more accurately, if the intersection of h Ã (x; k) and the stripping ability curve lies along h a , not h p . 23 f ¼ 0.05, I L ¼ 0.01, I N ¼ 0.0475,g ¼ 1:05,z ¼ 0:9, k ¼ 0.3, and d ¼ 0.945. Using (4), these values imply h max ¼ 0.8. The EXCEL program is available at http://www.econ.worldbank.org/staff/khoff. 24 One can show by standard methods that given a transition probability p per period, the expected number of periods before reform is 1/p. If x Ã ¼ 0.75, then p(x Ã ) ¼ 0.0625 and the expected delay is 16 periods.
