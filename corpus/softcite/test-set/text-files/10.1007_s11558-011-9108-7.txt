Model 6.3 moves away from the experiment to assess whether senators' length of tenure affects their voting behavior. Controlling for tenure length is important because senators may be more supportive of the IMF because they serve longer terms than representatives, rather than because they have larger constituencies. I assess this alternative institutional argument via variation among senators with respect to TIME TO ELECTION. This variable measures the number of years between an IMF roll-call vote and a senator's next election. It ranges from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that a senator is up for reelection later in the same year as the roll-call vote, and 5 indicates that the senator has 5 years remaining until her next election. 19 The evidence from Model 6.3 supports the "larger constituency" hypothesis: the point estimate for TIME TO ELECTION is 18 Interpreting interaction terms in non-linear models is not straightforward. For example, the direction and significance of the effect may be different for different observations (Ai and Norton 2003). Using the inteff command in STATA, I calculated the interaction effect correctly (Norton et al. 2004). This revealed that the interaction term SENATE * REP-AT-LARGE is not statistically significant at any level but positive for all observations. 19 Senators are divided into three classes for purposes of elections and every 2 years the members of one class-approximately one-third of the Senate-face election or reelection. Data on the class and election dates of senators are from Swift et al., Database of Congressional Historical Statistics.Bill and vote information obtained from the "Voteview" and the Library of Congress "Thomas" websites
