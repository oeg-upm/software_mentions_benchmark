10 (It can be derived from Equation (B3) in Appendix B.) From Equation (10), we know that an increase in t A increases the relative domestic price of the imported good. This is the Metzler paradox, in which the imposition of a tariff on imports decreases the relative internal price of that good. Under the paradoxical price changes, an increase in tariff will necessarily increase real purchasing power for domestic consumers. 11 The Matlab code is downloadable in mwkang.site11.com/code/rie2016. 12 The Ricardian model introduced in this paper has a combination of effects that include expansion and contraction, so it is not obvious whether the condition oEX(a,a 0 )/oa < 0 clearly represents the immiserizing growth effect. To clarify this issue, it is worth presenting a simple model of endowment economy. With the same CES utility functions as in Equation 18, country A's endowment for good (x, y) is ffiffi ffi k p a; 0 À Á and country B's endowment is 0; ffiffi ffi k p a 0 À Á . In this endowment economy, there exists closed form solutions for the equilibrium allocations, and the condition for country A's welfare to decrease as a increases is that E < 0.5 for any value of a 0 > 0, a ! a 0 , and k > 0, which is the same as the condition in Equation (21).
From a(b) and b(a), we can derive the Nash equilibrium specialization (a*,b*) which satisfies a (b*) 5 a* and b(a*) 5 b*. By the symmetric structure of the model, we always have a* 5 b. From the derivations of t A ðt B ; a; bÞ and t B ðt A ; a; bÞ, I apply a numerical analysis using Matlab. The Matlab code can be downloaded in mwkang.site11.com/code/rie2016.
