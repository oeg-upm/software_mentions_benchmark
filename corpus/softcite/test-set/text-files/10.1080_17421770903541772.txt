The opposite situation occurs when all cross-sectional units are assumed to be neighbours of each other and are given equal weights. In that case all off-diagonal elements of the spatial weights matrix are w ij 01. Since the row and column sums are N Á 1, these sums diverge to infinity as N goes to infinity. In contrast to the previous case, however, (N Á 1)/N01 instead of 0 as N goes to infinity. This implies that a spatial weights matrix that has equal weights and that is row normalized subsequently, w ij 01/(N(1), must be excluded for reasons of consistency. Figure 1 summarizes a family of eight linear spatial econometric models, among which are the non-spatial model in (1) on the right-hand side and the Manski model in (2) on the left-hand side. Each model to the right of the Manski model can be obtained from that model by imposing restrictions on one or more of its parameters. The kinds of restrictions are reported alongside the arrows in Figure 1.Some of the models recorded in Figure 1 are well known and frequently used in applied research, while other models are not. LeSage & Pace (p. 32) denote the model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and a spatially autocorrelated error term (Wo) by the term SAC, though without pointing out what this acronym is standing for. Since Kelejian & Prucha (1998) have been the main advocates of this model, it is therefore renamed the KelejianÁPrucha model in this paper. The model with a spatially lagged dependent variable (WY) and spatially lagged independent variables (WX) has been introduced by Anselin (1988) and is labelled the spatial Durbin model. A model with spatially lagged independent variables (WX) and a spatially autocorrelated error term has hardly been used in the literature. LeSage & Pace (pp. 41Á42) label it the spatial Durbin error model. Figure 1 seems to indicate that the best strategy to test for spatial interaction effects is to start with the most general model, i.e. the model that includes a spatially lagged dependent variable, spatially lagged independent variables, and a spatially autocorrelated error term simultaneously. However, as Manski (1993) notes, at least one of the K'2 interaction effects must be excluded, because otherwise the parameters are unidentified. To verify this, I carried out a simple Monte Carlo experiment generating Y by (2a) and (2b), one X variable drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval [Á1,1], r 0 a 0 b 0 u 0 l 0 0:25; s 2 00.01, N060, and a spatial weights matrix W corresponding to the corners of the seams in a soccer ball (in Matlab known as the Bucky Ball). Based on 1,000 repetitions, I found biases in the parameter estimates of the endogenous and exogenous interaction effects (r and u, respectively) that may be as great as 0.0423 and, related to that, standard deviations that may be as great as 0.2677. These results corroborate Manski's (1993, p. 534) finding that there are no technical obstacles to estimating a model with interaction effects among the dependent variable, the independent variables and the disturbance terms, but that the parameter estimates cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way since the endogenous and exogenous effects cannot be distinguished from each other.
One of the merits of LeSage & Pace's book is that they offer another criterion to select models, namely the Bayesian posterior model probability. Whereas tests for significant differences between log-likelihood function values, such as the LRtest, can formally not be used if models are non-nested (i.e. based on different spatial weights matrices), Bayesian posterior model probabilities do not require nested models to carry out these comparisons (p. 162). The basic idea is to set prior probabilities equal to 1/S, making each model equally likely a priori, to estimate each model by Bayesian methods, and then to compute posterior probabilities based on the data and the estimation results of this set of S models. Although the mathematics of this approach might deter potential users (Chs 5 and 6), my experience with this approach is positive. First, posterior model probabilities may differ widely even if the estimation results appear to be quite robust to different specifications of the spatial weights matrix. In a study I did on cross-country differences in governance (Seldadyo et al., 2010), the posterior model probability of a 10 nearest-neighbour matrix appeared to be more than six times as large as that of an inverse distance matrix, more than three times as large as that of a five nearestneighbour matrix, and more than twice as large as an inverse distance matrix with a cut-off point. Second, since Matlab routines applying Bayesian methods to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models are made downloadable for free on LeSage's website (www.spatial-econometrics.com), these kinds of comparisons can be carried out relatively easily. Furthermore, since LeSage also provides Matlab routines applying the Bayesian method to the spatial lag, spatial error and spatial Durbin models of limited dependent variables, similar types of selection procedures as discussed in this and the previous sections can be used for empirical problems requiring a probit or tobit approach (Ch. 10).
One possible way to calculate the dispersion of the direct and indirect effects is to apply formulae for the sum, the difference, the product and the quotient of random variables (see, among others, Mood et al., 1974, pp. 178Á181). However, owing to the complexity of the matrix of partial derivatives [see (6)] and because every empirical application will have its own unique number of observations (N) and spatial weights matrix (W), it is almost impossible to derive one general approach that can be applied under all circumstances. In order to draw inferences regarding the statistical significance of the direct and indirect effects, LeSage & Pace (p. 39) therefore suggest simulating the distribution of the direct and indirect effects using the varianceÁcovariance matrix implied by the maximum likelihood estimates. Elhorst & Fréret (2009) Using the Matlab routine 'sar' posted on LeSage's website (www.spatial- econometrics.com), one particular parameter combination drawn from this varianceÁcovariance matrix (indexed by d ) can be obtained by:
