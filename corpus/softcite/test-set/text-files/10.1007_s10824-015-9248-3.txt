The geographic distance between the entrepreneurs and the donors was obtained for the cities where they were located, and we used Google Maps APIs (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/) to identify the coordinates of each location. The distance was calculated using the procedure adopted by Nichols (2003) with the tool ArcGIS ArcMap 10.0 (ESRI 2010). The motivation for using these types of tools comes from the argument that when the data's spatial distribution is related to the phenomena occurring in the territory, one has a modern way to clarify questions related to various fields of knowledge (Ebner et al. 2009). The use of these techniques in the business field is in an embryonic stage (Goodchild 2010), especially in studies of collaborative phenomena (Sui et al. 2013). In addition, geographical information systems (GISs) could be a tool toward providing a spatial explanation of governance, population and cultural assets (Redaelli 2012).
