The data were collected during 2002-2004. The objective of the questionnaire was to gather information about the workers' knowledge of the occupational risks connected with their occupation, possible work-related occupational hazards, and attitudes towards using personal protective equipment and safety routines. Questions about the workers' opinions and their perceptions about the exposure to occupational risks (noise, chemicals, vibration, bad microclimate, insuffi cient lighting, and ergonomics), experienced health symptoms and their awareness of the Occupational Health and Safety Act were also asked. The workers were randomly selected from textile, printing, mechanical, plastic, food processing industries and offi ces. A questionnaire was distributed to 412 workers in investigated industries. The average age was 43.6 years. Confi dentiality of information was always maintained and only coded information was used in the analysis. Data collected on the questionnaire study was coded and then entered into the statistical software programme (Excel) for analyses. The investigation gave results as follows: 1. 65% of workers considered excessive exposure to noise, 60% bad microclimate (too cold workrooms), 54% bad lighting at workplaces; not-effective ventilation was the main occupational risk factor (75% of workplaces). 2. Only some of the workers (10%) answered that they know which information about the dangerousness of chemicals may be obtained from the chemical labels. Nobody of respondents pointed at the chemical safety data sheets as one of the important source of information. 3. Most of the workers (80%) reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was accessible; however, the questionnaire did not show the attitudes towards using PPE. Some of the respondents (36%) pointed that the PPE disturbs the work; others mentioned (46%) that the quality of PPE is not very good. 4. In the present study, 63% of the workers reported that they were aware of the person who was the working environment specialist in their company. At the same time, only 20% of workers knew who was elected to be their working environment representative. 5. Different opinions were given on safety instructions and guidelines. In the present study, 25% of the workers reported that they had not received safety instructions and guidelines. The assessment of the safety instructions was made on a 6-point scale (from 0 to 5, where 0 was bad and 5 -very good). According to workers' opinion, the quality of accessed safety instruction was satisfactory (2.8 points). 6. The questionnaire revealed that only 25% were generally aware of the safety legislation.
