19. Power calculations can be performed in STATA using sampsi or SAS using proc power. many participants would clearly be prohibitively expensive. 20 To detect a treatment-control difference of 0.02, which is 10% of the control group mean, the sample size would have to be 6,510 observations. The effect size would have to be 0.10 (or 50% of the control group mean) to be statistically detectable with sample sizes in the range of what is available in this experiment.
