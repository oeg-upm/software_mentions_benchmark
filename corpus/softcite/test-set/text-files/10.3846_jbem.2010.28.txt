Negotiation is an everyday task. Except for simple and typical situations like discussing the task shared in a family (i.e. walking the dog, cleaning the apartment, etc.) influencing someone to change their mind or dividing the scarce resources, it includes also the complex deliberations between the companies, political parties or nations. We can describe negotiation situation as the problem of making decision about parties' interdependent goals and objectives (Lewicki et al. 1999). Moreover, the parties are committed to peaceful means of solving the problem and there is no clear or established method of making the decision. Usually, while thinking of the negotiation we consider a regular face-to-face meeting where the parties are sitting at the negotiation table and solving the problem using some advisors, analysts, facilitators or mediators. But we live in the time of technological explosion, and nowadays it influences nearly all the activities undertaken by humans, including negotiation. Negotiations are consequently being conducted by means of the electronic media, starting with simple phone calls, through the videoconferences, online chatting, with the use of software negotiation support system (NSS), ending with the electronic negotiation system (ENS) -a software that employs Internet technologies and is deployed on the web for the purpose of facilitating, organizing, supporting and/or automating activities undertaken by the negotiators and/or the third party (Kersten and Lai 2007). More and more people and organizations are deciding to negotiate electronically, since it saves time and money and allows to develop and maintain the business contacts regardless of the distance of time and space between the counterparts. Therefore, the negotiation support tools are still being developed to make the negotiation process more fluent and bring negotiators closer to the most satisfying agreement. Usually, these systems implement the formal models deriving from operational research and decision science that are used to help negotiators define negotiation space, evaluate offers and determine efficient solutions. There are a lot of NSSs and ENSs that have been used for simulating, training and teaching negotiations or for research purposes like INSPIRE (Kersten and Noronha 1999), Negoisst (Schoop et al. 2003), NeGoGo (Lai et al. 2007) or NegoCalc (Wachowicz 2008). Lots of theoretical and practical solutions for electronic negotiation support are also proposed in the literature, that focuse on both the methodological and applicational aspects of electronic negotiations (see Stroebel and Weinhardt 2003; Urbanavičienė et al. 2009a, b). Unfortunately, there are only a few examples of using the formal models and systems in the large and complex real-world negotiations of business or political nature. One of them was introducing the Deep Ocean Mining Model into the United Nations' UNCLOS III negotiations (Sebenius 1984) concerning the rights to exploit the deep sea. It allowed to make a consensus between the developed and developing countries according to the profits sharing. Another system, developed by International Institute for Applied System Analysis, is RAINS (Hordijk 1991), which was used in the international negotiations between the European countries on the air pollution limits. Some other systems are still being developed to support real-world problems like Familly_Winner (Bellucci and Zeleznikow 2005) designed on Victoria University, Australia, for supporting divorcing disputes or Smartsettle (Thiessen and Soberg 2003), which is now being adapted to support negotiations between First Nations and the Government of Alberta Province in Canada (Thiessen and Shakun 2009).
Having completed all four steps of the above procedure we obtain a full scoring system of the feasible offers. Negotiators can use this system to compare proposals submitted by their counterparts and analyze the differences between quality (satisfaction rate) of the subsequent offers (that have the interval scale interpretation). Negotiators can also observe how the score is determined while the options are added or changed within the offer they prepare. The system allows also to follow the negotiation progress by analyzing the concession paths -the shape of the graph built with scores of successive offers submitted both by the negotiator himself and his counterpart. Such a solution is commonly applied in the NSS, for example in Inspire (Kersten and Noronha 1999), Smartsettle (Thiessen and Soberg 2003) or Negoisst (Schoop et al. 2003). An example of scoring negotiation offers with additive scoring system in Inspire ENS is shown in Fig. 2.
Even-swap based scoring system was applied in a simple spreadsheet based negotiation support tool called NegoCalc (Wachowicz 2008). The key stages of building the negotiation offers' scoring system in NegoCalc are shown in Fig. 3. First the base issue has been selected as the price, and then, after identification of the best options for all remaining issues (building time and warranty time), the equivalent amounts for even swaps in terms of price have been declared.
Both an additive scoring system and even-swap based scoring system can be used in the offer's formulation process for analyzing in details the trade-offs between issues and options. While building the offer (i.e. adding the propositions for reservation levels of successive issues) negotiator can observe how the overall score changes. He can immediately react if the score is lower than his aspiration level by balancing with different combination of options (increasing value of one issue, while decreasing it for another). The process of building negotiation offer in NegoCalc system is presented in Fig. 7.
