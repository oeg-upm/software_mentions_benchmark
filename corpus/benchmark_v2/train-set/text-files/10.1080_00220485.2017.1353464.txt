The second stage of research occurs in Introduction to Econometrics, usually taken in the junior year. This course convenes in our econometrics lab, which has 28 computers. Enrollments are capped at 22 students per section due to the heavy burden that draft editing imposes on the professor. The course covers standard econometric topics: estimation using OLS, hypothesis testing, serial correlation and time series, as well as introduction to more advanced topics such as panel data, instrumental variables, and logit/probit estimation. Data analysis is conducted with STATA, which students begin using the second week of class, and the instruction tends to be applied rather than mathematical/algebraic. A required one-hour lab was added 25 years ago to provide extra instruction time to cover research methods. The course also receives extensive support from our library staff who have developed instruction modules and resource guides to assist students with their research.
We are fortunate to have facilities that support student research. About three decades ago, the department received an NSF grant to build a computer lab, and the college continues to invest in this space with new hardware (28 Macs) and software (STATA). Our introductory and advanced econometrics courses benefit a great deal from the lab, and it is a hub for research activity throughout the year. The walls of the lab are covered with plaques that commemorate research-paper prizes our students have won, and we hope that they inspire the younger students.
