Crystallization experiments were performed by the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique at 4 C using a sparse matrix screen (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) (20). A quantity of 1 ml complex solution was mixed with 1 ml of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 40 ml reservoir wells. Crystals appeared in droplets containing 0.2 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) and 20% (w/v) PEG 8000 within 2-3 days. Crystals were mounted in nylon loops, cryo-protected in reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected using either a Mar225 or Mar300 CCD detector on the 21-ID F/D beam lines of the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL, USA). Data were integrated and scaled with the program HKL2000 (21). The structures were determined by the Molecular Replacement technique using the program MOLREP (22,23) and the BhRNase H structure with PDB ID code 3D0P (protein alone) as the search model. Initial refinement was carried out with the program REFMAC (24) and DNA duplexes were then gradually built into the electron density, 2-3 bp at a time, followed by further refinement. Manual rebuilding was performed with the program COOT (25). Water molecules and metal ions were added gradually and isotropic/ Translation Libration Screw-motion (TLS) refinement was continued with the program PHENIX (26). A summary of crystallographic parameters is provided in Table 1. Helical parameters were calculated with the program CURVES (27). Illustrations were generated with the program UCSF Chimera (28).
