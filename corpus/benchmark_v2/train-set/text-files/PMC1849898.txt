Based on their results, it was assumed that the yields of otherwise poorly expressed genes might be stimulated byplacing the optimal nucleotide sequences beforehand. It was also expected that such a stimulatory sequence could be used as a universal translation enhancer to increase the productivity of recombinant proteins. In search of the nucleotide sequences that possibly enhance the expression of their fusion partners, the python script was used to analyze the codon usage in the entire E.coli genome. Interestingly, it was found that the nucleotide sequences of many signal peptides had strong bias for AAA as the second codon. Approximately 40% of signal peptides had the AAA triplet as the second codon (Table 2).
