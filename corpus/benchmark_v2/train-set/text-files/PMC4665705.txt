Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed usingSPSS software, version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The experimental values were analyzed using the paired-samples t-test and were expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was calculated to determine the differences between groups for each parameter at each time point. Non-parametrical Kruskal-Wallis tests were used when equal variances were not assumed in one-way ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
