We can find some noticeable examples of disruptive innovations in the telecommunications industry: Skype that has gained the benefits of the market of long-voice telephony, numerous Internet messengers, that partly substituted SMS services or even traditional voice services, or Internet video streaming services such as NetFlix. However, the majority of these examples shares one distinctive feature that, in general, does not entirely fit the concept of disruptive technologies: entering the telecommunications market from the outside they have not undermined the positions of the incumbents of the industry.
Indeed, from this point of view these innovations of telecommunications services differ significantly from other examples of disruptiveness. The appearance of smartphones subverted the market of mobile phones and destroyed the business of the former leader of the market Nokia. The introduction of digital photo cameras ruined the business of Kodak. At the same time, the appearance of Skype, despite of the undeniable significance of the innovation for the industry, has not destroyed the business of British Telecom, Deutsche Telecom or Telefonica. There are some concerns of the incumbents about Bcommodization^of their services (Larouche 2007; Kushida 2015), but it does not mean the loss of their places under the sun.
