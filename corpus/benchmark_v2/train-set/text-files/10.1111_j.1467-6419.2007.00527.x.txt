The bulk of software tools to implement matching and estimate treatment effects is growing and allows researchers to choose the appropriate tool for their purposes. The most commonly used platform for these tools is Stata and we will present the three most distributed ones here. Becker and Ichino (2002) provide a programme for PSM estimators (pscore, attnd, attnw, attr, atts, attk) which includes estimation routines for NN, kernel, radius, and stratification matching. To obtain standard errors the user can choose between bootstrapping and the variance approximation proposed by Lechner (2001a). Additionally the authors offer balancing tests (blocking, stratification) as discussed in Section 3.4. Leuven and Sianesi (2003) provide the programme psmatch2 for implementing different kinds of matching estimators including covariate and propensity score matching. It includes NN and caliper matching (with and without replacement), KM, radius matching, LLM and Mahalanobis metric (covariate) matching. Furthermore, this programme includes routines for common support graphing (psgraph) and covariate imbalance testing (pstest). Standard errors are obtained using bootstrapping methods.
