Microbial phylum comparisons. All the OTU tables were retrieved from our earlier study (10).The percentages of relative abundance for all phyla were used to compare the mothers (divided into two groups). Statistical package SPSS was used for thet test and to make box plots of the percentages of relative abundance.
Methylation sequencing data analysis. The raw sequence data were mapped to hg19 reference genome sequences with Life Tech- nologies Bioscope (version 2.0) software using the default parameters, yielding on average 56.7 M mapped reads per sample (standard deviation, 14.26 M reads). The read counts for proximal promoters (region between 1,000 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream from the transcription start site, coordinates derived from RefSeq gene annotations) were calculated using bedtools (version 2.17.0). Statistical analysis for comparing differentially methylated promoters between sample groups was carried out using R/Bioconductor limma package on TMM-normalized and voomtransformed count values as suggested in the limma manual (19, 20). The promoters with absolute fold changes above 2 and P values below 0.05 were listed as significantly differentially methylated.
