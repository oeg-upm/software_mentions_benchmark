Molecular biological analyses. Molecular analyses were carried out for the original production water and incubated water from [2-13 C]-acetate labeled microcosms (at day 116 and 103 for the control and the CO 2 -injected microcosms, respectively). Total DNA was extracted from a 0.22-mm-pore-size polycarbonate membrane filter (Millipore, MA, USA), concentrating 250 ml of the original production water, 15 ml of the control microcosm water and 40 ml of the CO 2 -injected microcosm water, using a FastDNA Spin kit (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified with primer sets Eub8F/Univ1490R 24 and Ar109F 25 /Univ1490R, respectively. PCR products were cloned using the pT7 Blue T-vector kit (Novagen, CA, USA). Clones were randomly selected (in archaeal libraries, original production water; 32 clones, control microcosm; 39 clones, CO 2 -injected microcosm; 35 clones, in bacterial libraries, original production water; 49 clones, control microcosm; 92 clones, CO 2 -injected microcosm; 84 clones), and the inserted 16S rRNA gene was directly amplified with T7 promoter primer and U-19mer primer (Novagen). Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes was carried out with a BigDye Version 3.1 reaction on an ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Chimeric sequences were detected with the Bellerophon server 26 and removed from the sequence data sets. To group the OTUs and drawrarefaction curves, sequences were analyzed using FastGroupII program 27 with 97% sequence similarity. Representative sequences from each OTU were compared with those in public databases using the Seqmatch program from the Ribosomal Database Project (Release 10, Update 12) to identify the nearest neighbors. The specific primer and probe set for archaea, hydrogenotrophic methanogens (the orders Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales), and acetoclastic methanogens (the order Methanosarcinales) used in quantitative real-time PCR to determine the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were previously designed in the study by Yu et al. 28 All real-time PCR assays were performed with iCycler iQ using the iQ Supermix reaction kit (Bio-Rad, California, USA), as previously described in the study by Mayumi et al. 15 Standard curves for each assay were constructed using nearly full-length 16Tref,Pref is the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction at the reference temperature and pressure (0.1 MPa; 1 atm), P act is the in situ pressure in atm, P ref is the reference pressure in atm and DV o is the partial molar volume change of the reaction at the reference temperature and pressure in cm 3 mol Ã€ 1 , as outlined in the study by Wang et al. 29
