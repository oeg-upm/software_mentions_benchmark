Data were expressed as means Â± standard deviation (SD) for quantitative variables. Qualitative data are represented as relative percentages. The Student t test and chi-square test were used for comparison of clinical and radiological data. Multivariate regression was used to analyze the clinical outcome effects of any independent variables. Multivariate regression was adjusted for age, gender, spinal cord compressing rate, mean duration of symptoms, pre-and postoperative sagittal diameter, pre-and postoperative modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score (mJOA), pre-and postoperative PCS, pre-and postoperative MCS, and surgical method (HPLL removing = 1; HPLL retaining = 0). [17] A P-value less than 0.05 (P < .05) was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software package 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
