We present a statistical model for German medical natural language processing trained for named entity recognition (NER) as an open, publicly available model. The work serves as a refined successor to our first GERNERMED model which is substantially outperformed by our work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multiple techniques in order to achieve strong results in entity recognition performance by the means of transfer-learning on pretrained deep language models (LM), word-alignment and neural machine translation. Due to the sparse situation on open, public medical entity recognition models for German texts, this work offers benefits to the German research community on medical NLP as a baseline model. Since our model is based on public English data, its weights are provided without legal restrictions on usage and distribution.
