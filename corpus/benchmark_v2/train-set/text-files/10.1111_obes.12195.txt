(2012), CDRT and Cavaliere et al. (2016) to the case of larger dimensional VARs. Moreover, in order to fully exploit the potential of the conditional analysis we specify a 'full' (and rather arbitrary) structure for the covariance matrix such that the resultant matrix in equation (2) is non-zero for all DGPs considered. 5 The initial conditions X −1 and X 0 are fixed to zero. Data are generated by setting a = −0.4 and = 0.5. The settings for the parameter c are discussed below because in our Monte Carlo design the condition c = 0 is related to the 3 All calculations in this and in the next section have been performed in OxMetrics and MATLAB. Codes are available from the authors upon request. 4 Note that the assumption := (1, 0,…, 0) does not imply any loss of generality. Indeed, any process X t satisfying equation (1) under the I(1,r 0 ) conditions with r 0 = 1 and = (1, 0,…, 0) can be suitably linearly transformed into the new process X * t such that * X * t ∼ I (0) with * := (1, 0,…, 0) . The likelihood ratio test is invariant to such rotation. 5 The matrix has been obtained using the following spectral decomposition: = GDG , where the diagonal elements of D are generated randomly from a truncated standard normal and the elements of G are generated randomly using the standard normal distribution and such that GG = I p . The specific matrix used in our simulations is available upon request to the authors. We also considered Monte Carlo experiments based on specifications of leading to = 0 in equation (2). Also in this case, results are available upon request to the authors. failure of the weak exogeneity of the conditional variables. Samples of length T = 100, 200 and 1,000 are generated M = 5, 000 times from VARs of the form equation (7) with k = 2 lags. 6 For each generated sample, the partial (conditional) system (2) is estimated and the procedure for co-integration rank determination discussed in section III is applied. In particular, to evaluate the impact of the dimension of the conditioning variable vector Z t on the ability of the information criteria to determine the true co-integration rank, we consider the partition X t = (Y t , Z t ), where the dimension of Y t ranges from two to four, i.e. p Y = 2, 3 and 4, which implies a dimension for Z t of p Z = 5, 4 and 3, respectively. Thus, it is seen that the scalar parameter c in the matrix in equation (7) determines whether Z t is weakly exogenous (c = 0) or not (c = 0) for .
