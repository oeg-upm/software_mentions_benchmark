For further details we refer the Reader to Meyer and Yu (2000). Estimation of SV model was performed using OpenBugs program of Meyer and Yu (2000). First 10 000 iterations were treated as the ''burn-out'' period, while next 10,000-as the sample from the posterior distribution. Estimation of conditional mean was performed in OxMetrics 6.1 program.
