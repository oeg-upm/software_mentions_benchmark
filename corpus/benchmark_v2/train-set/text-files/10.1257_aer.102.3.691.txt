Greene (NYU) and John Siegfried (Vanderbilt) contributing on two modules. The modules deal with heteroskedasticity; endogenous regressors with natural experiments, instrumental variables, and two-stage estimators; panel data; and sample selection issues. Each module features "real-world" datasets and sample programs written in Stata, SAS, and Limdep. Information on website "hits" is now available for the period corresponding to the 2011 "spring semester" at most US schools, from January-May 2011. The monthly average over this period was 220 hits/ views, with more hits in early and middle months of the "term." It appears (as supported by anecdotal accounts) that the modules and datasets are being used in many econometrics classes as general teaching tools, not just to introduce research topics in economic education.
