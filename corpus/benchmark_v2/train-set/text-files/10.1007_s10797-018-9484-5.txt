The matched dataset is then used to simulate a property tax reform that applies current market values instead of cadastral values. In a first scenario, we assess the potential revenue gain induced by the use of up-to-date property values. Next, we simulate a revenue-neutral scenario in which the additional revenue is used to lower social insurance contributions (SIC) via a lump sum SIC credit. As a third scenario, we simulate a proportional reduction of social insurance contributions, again under revenue neutrality. All simulations are carried out using EUROMOD-the tax-benefit microsimulation model for EU member states. It allows us to evaluate changes in households' disposable income induced by the different scenarios. Our baseline simulations focus on first-order effects of the three reform scenarios. In addition, we also discuss the relevance of second-order effects in our context, and provide robustness checks in the Appendix accounting for potential labor supply responses.
In addition, our results speak to the literature analyzing the distributive effects of tax shifts from labor income toward other tax bases such as consumption (e.g., Pestel and Sommer 2017). So far, little empirical work has been dedicated to property tax related simulations, mostly driven by data limitations. A notable exception is Moscarola et al. (2015), assessing labor market reactions to a property and labor tax reform in Italy. In a similar vein, Figari et al. (2017) investigate the fiscal and distributional consequences of including homeowners' imputed rent in personal taxable income as a kind of property tax for six European countries. Using up-to-date property values to determine property taxes could be regarded as an important complement (and maybe even as a substitute depending on the specific design) to housing income taxation. Finally, Kuypers et al. (2017) currently create a EUROMOD input database directly from the HFCS dataset. Their approach aims at broadening the scope of EUROMOD by including information on wealth from HFCS, but they do not combine this with EU-SILC data. The novelty of our paper is the creation of a new dataset via statistical matching that allows analyses regarding two variables which have never been jointly observed, namely the current property tax liability and the actual market value of the property. Our approach may potentially be extended to other European countries covered by EUROMOD, providing a fruitful avenue for further research.
Our policy reform simulations are performed on EUROMOD (version G2.0), the tax-benefit microsimulation model designed for EU member states. It applies national tax-benefit policy rules to harmonized microdata and calculates their effects on household disposable income (Sutherland and Figari 2013). Unlike computable general equilibrium (CGE) approaches, the only assumptions we impose concern our proposed reform scenarios, or the elasticity of labor supply. Our approach is in the spirit of recent research, for instance on fiscal sustainability (Dolls et al. 2017), income distribution analysis (Bargain et al. 2015), or mortgage interest deductibility (Figari et al. 2017). Thus, we follow well-established simulation techniques using EUROMOD, allowing for inferences about the distributional and revenue effects of a tax shift from labor to property. The German component of EUROMOD reproducing the 2010 German tax-benefit system has been validated through comparison with aggregate statistics provided by fiscal authorities (Ochmann and Granados 2011). We run all tax-benefit policy rules at their 2010 setting and then augment the model with a simulated change in property and labor taxation. Hence, our simulation model calculates household disposable income under the current as well as the reformed tax-benefit rules holding everything else constant and, therefore, avoiding endogeneity problems (Bourguignon and Spadaro 2006).
