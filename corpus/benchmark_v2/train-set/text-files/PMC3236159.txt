11 (Figure 1 12-20 Figure 2 12-24 Articles were selected if VPW was measured on CR in patients in either erect or supine positions and if volume overload had been evaluated by invasive and/or noninvasive techniques, including pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), global end diastolic volume, intrathoracic blood volume index, left atrial emptying fraction (LAEF), or total blood volume. Studies that did not report a mean value or standard deviation (SD) were excluded. Two reviewers also independently assessed each included study and evaluated the quality of each article using the Jadad score. 25 The mean VPW, SD, correlation coefficient, and sample size were obtained from each study. Comprehensive meta- analysis software 2.2 and Stata 11 (College Station, Texas) were used for data analysis. 26 The summary effect of mean VPW (weighted mean) was estimated by assigning weight as the inverse of its variance method in the fixed effects of metaanalysis. 27 A random effect model, utilizing the DerSimonian and Laird method, estimated the summary effect of mean VPW. 28 Similarly, fixed and random effects were estimated for cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) as well as correlation coefficiency. Two subgroups, erect and supine, were analyzed for VPW values. The Q-test, which is a chi-square method, was used for comparison between these 2 groups based on Cochran method. 29 A P value less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference between groups.
