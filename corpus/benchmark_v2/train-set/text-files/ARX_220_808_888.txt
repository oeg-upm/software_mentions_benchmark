The performance of the proposed POCS-based clustering algorithm is verified through experiments on various synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed POCS-based clustering algorithm is competitive and efficient in terms of clustering error and execution speed when compared with other conventional clustering methods including Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and K-Means clustering algorithms.
