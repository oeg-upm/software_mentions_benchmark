We link the UMETRICS data to the 2010 census via a person identifier, used internally by the Census Bureau, called the Protected Identification Key (PIK). PIKs are assigned through the Person Identification Validation System (PVS), which uses probability record linkage techniques and personal information such as name, date of birth, and residential location (Wagner and Layne 2014). Once a PIK is assigned to a record, the Personally Identifiable Information is removed so analysts can anonymously link individuals across files for statistical and research purposes. Person records in the census contain date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, and relationship to the head of household (HH), the last of which permits inference about certain relationships within a household. Marital status is modeled for graduate students who are either the HH or listed as a spouse or unmarried partner of the HH. Individuals are characterized as having children when they are, or are married to, the HH and there are (step) children of the HH present. 1 1 This approach provides valuable information but has two main limitations. First, we can only infer marital status The PIK is used to link to W-2 earnings, which cover total annual wages, tips, and other compensation from the job with the highest earnings in each year from 2005 and 2012. Linking to the LEHD provides establishment identifiers, and linking on those establishment identifiers to the BR, LBD, and ILBD provides sector of employment.
