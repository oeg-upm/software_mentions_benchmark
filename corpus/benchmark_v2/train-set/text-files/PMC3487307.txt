Methods for interpretation of the LV and RV measures have been previously reported. [15,16] Briefly, RV image analysis was performed by two independent analysts on Windows workstations using QMASS software (v4.2,Medis, The Netherlands). The endocardial and epicardial borders of the RV were traced manually on short-axis cine images at end-diastole and end-systole. Papillary muscles and trabeculae were included in the RV volumes and excluded from RV mass. [17] RVEDV and RVESV were calculated using Simpson's rule by summation of areas on each slice multiplied by the sum of slice thickness and image gap. RV mass was determined at end-diastole as the difference between end-diastolic epicardial and endocardial volumes multiplied by the specific gravity of the heart (1.05 g/cm 3). [15] RVSV was calculated by subtracting RVESV from RVEDV. RVEF was calculated by dividing RVSV by RVEDV. The intra-reader intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) from random, blinded re-reads of 229 scans for RV mass was 0.94 and for 230 scans was 0.99, 0.95, and 0.89 for RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF, respectively. The intra-reader ICC was 0.96 for RVSV. The inter-reader ICCs from random, blinded re-reads of 240 scans for RV mass, RVEDV, RVESV, and RVEF were 0.89, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.80, respectively. The inter-reader ICC for RVSV was 0.93.
