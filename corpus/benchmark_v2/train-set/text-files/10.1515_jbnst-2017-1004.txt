During the last decade, the research group of the second author has developed a Java program for record linkage called Merge Toolbox (MTB, Schnell et al., 2004). GRLC has extended the capabilities of the program by including routines for privacy preserving record linkage (Schnell et al., 2009), special routines for self-generated-identification codes (Schnell et al., 2010) and updated the input/output-options so that MTB is able to read and write CSV files and native binary Stata-15 files. MTB consists of different modules such as a data editor for record linkage and the main linkage module. Since 2012, MTB has been downloaded by 1104 researchers. MTB is discussed in the leading textbook on record linkage by Christen (2012). An implementation of multibit-trees for privacy preserving record linkage based on Bloomfilters (Schnell, 2015) is provided as a C++ stand-alone program and as a library for R.
Due to the research on privacy preserving record linkage within the GRLC, many new functions for encrypting linkage keys have been developed (Schnell and Borgs, 2016). These new functions have not been implemented in MTB, but in a new R library PPRL. Since record linkage often involves large datasets with millions of records, most functions within PPRL have been been optimized for speed using C++ as the main language. The PPRL library will be released within 2017 as an open-source project.
