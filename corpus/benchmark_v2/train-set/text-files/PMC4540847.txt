All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows (v. 12.0 K, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The results were expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation (SD) and number (percent). The general and clinical characteristics of the patients in the exercise and non-exercise groups, including age, height, weight, and others results, were analyzed with the independent t-test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess the relation between metabolic regulation (blood pressure, glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL and LDL cholesterol) and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, univariate logistic regression was used to assess the associations between achievement of goals for metabolic regulation of medical characteristics and complications and exercise in patients with type 2 diabetes. The odds ratios for each factor in each model were calculated with Wald-type 95% confidence intervals.
