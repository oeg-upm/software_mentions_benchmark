Establishment attributes such as location, industry and ownership are obtained from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS). 18 The database provides information on the universe of all establishments that opened for business in Iowa and North Carolina in 2000-2002. The database also includes DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) numbers of establishments and of their headquarters or parent companies. If an own DUNS number is the same as that of a headquarters or a parent company, the establishment is considered a "stand-alone start-up." 19 Otherwise, it is considered an "expansion start-up." Urban (rural) expansion start-ups are about 8 percent (6 percent) of urban (rural) start-ups in the sample period. We use three-digit and four-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes used in 1997 Standard Use Table from the that our main results are robust to unobservable time-varying location-specific factors. Estimates and elasticities are available upon request. 16 We used STATA command "multin" in a package named "groupcl" to estimate the grouped conditional logit. See Guimaraes and Lindrooth (2007) for information on the estimator. (http://www.stata.com/meeting/5nasug/NASUG_Guimaraes.pdf, accessed on June 19, 2014). 17 The following industries are excluded: Agriculture (two-digit NAICS: 11), Mining (21)Bureau of Economic Analysis to define industries. The total number of industries is K = 112.
