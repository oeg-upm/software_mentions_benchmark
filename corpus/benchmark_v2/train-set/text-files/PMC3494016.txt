F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 mouse tumors display partial inhibition of DNA damage p53-dependent regulatory network response. As commented above, the absence of pRb and p107 leads to partial impairment of p53-dependent functions. To further confirm these findings, we analyzed the expression patterns of p53-responsive genes in Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 compared with normal skin. To this, we used GSEA of genes induced or repressed by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner 32. Our results indicated that although p53-activated genes are very significantly underexpressed in the tumors, the p53-repressed genes do not display overexpression in tumors (Table II)carcinomas displayed partial inhibition of p53 function as transcriptional regulator, corroborating the luciferase experiments (Fig. 2b).;Trp53 F/F ;K14cre genotypes) 33.
The panel of phosphorylation profiles of kinases were analyzed following manufacter recomendations (Human Phospho-Kinase Array, ARY003, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Membranes were incubated with 500 mg of protein extract from skin and tumor samples. This array screens for relative levels of phosphorylation of 39 proteins. Quantification of the relative expression of specific phosphorylated protein was determined by QuantityOne software (BioRad).
Methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Genomic DNA samples (1 mg) were modified by sodium bisulphite using the CpGenome DNA modification kit (Intergen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA methylation status of the promoter region of Pten and cdkn1a genes was analyzed by methylation specific PCR (MSP) after sodium bisulphite modification of DNA. Mouse genomic DNA universally methylated for all genes (Zymo Research) was used as a positive control for methylated alleles. Water blanks were included with each assay. Following amplification, PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis through a 2carcinomas. RNA was obtained from 4 normal wild type control skin samples and 10 carcinomas from Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 genotype, and purified from mice tissue as previously described 8. Hybridization was done to Affymetrix Mouse GE MOE430 2.0 array. Raw and processed data were deposited in the GEO database with the accession identifier GSE38257. Supervised analysis of differential expression between tumors and normal tissue was done using SAM  test 53 available in the open source software Multiexperiment Viewer (MeV) 54, using 200 random permutations. For further analyses, a number of 1128 probesets (representing 2.5% of the array) were selected by fold change as overexpressed in the carcinomas or underexpressed (giving rise to 2256 deregulated probesets). Using this approach, all selected probesets display highly significant q-values (q-val50) and fold change values from 4.38 to 4.16 (for overexpressed) or from 24.38 to 24.10 (for underexpressed). MOE430 2.0 Affymetrix chip probeset IDs were mapped to human using Ailun web utility 55. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms was done upon uploading selected probesets identifiers into DAVID Functional Annotation web tool, which computes enrichment of GO biological processes terms using EASE score 56,57. Enrichment analysis of p53-regulated genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 58,59 was used to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 58,59 was used to compare the gene expression pattern of the mouse Rb F/F ;K14creER TM ;p107 2/2 tumors with other gene signatures. In Table 1, we analyze the enrichment with a collection of 2392 different gene sets (available at http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/ collections.jsp) that represents gene expression signatures of genetic and chemical perturbations (subgroup c2.cgp). A selection of some relevant and highly statistically significant enriched gene sets was done. We permutated the gene set for 1000 times rather than permutating the phenotype because the sample number is small. In Table 2, we analyze the enrichment of p53-activated and p53-repressed DNA damage response genes in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells within the mouse tumors when compared to normal skin. Gene sets were downloaded from 32, and fall into 2 groups: i) 2070 genes activated and ii) 1627 genes repressed upon p53 activation with DNA damage agent adriamycin as determined by both ChIP-seq (with a pan-p53 antibody) and GE (GE) microarray data of mES cells 32. ES and 14-d differentiated ES gene expression dataset was retrieved from the GEO database (GSE2972).
