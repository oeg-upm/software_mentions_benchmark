STATA/SE 11.0(Stata Corp LP, http://www.stata.com) was used to perform the statistical analysis. Dichotomous data is calculated as the risk ratio (RR) with a95% confidence interval (CI). Measurement data was demonstrated by mean with its standard difference and pooled by standard mean difference (SMD). Statistical heterogeneity of the results across the included studies was evaluated by Chi-square (χ 2 ) test [8], and the inconsistency was calculated by I2 [9]. If heterogeneity was found (χ 2 , p<0.05 or I2>50%), the random-effect method (Dersimonian-Laird method) was used to pool the data. Otherwise, without significant heterogeneity, fixed-effect method was used. The Egger's tests were performed to evaluate publication bias as described by Egger [10]. [5, 6, 11-19] with 457 cases in the surgery+TCM and 386 subjects in the control group were included in this meta-analysis Figure 1). The general information for the included studies was demonstrated in Table 1.
