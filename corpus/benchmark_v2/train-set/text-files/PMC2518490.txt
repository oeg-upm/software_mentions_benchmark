The present study describes a gentle and reproducible technique for forming EC-MSC islets that is designed to take into consideration the inherent characteristics of the various cell types involved and to take advantage of the anchorage-dependent growth of ECs and MSCs. Our data demonstrate that addition of MSCs to our composite islets enhanced the capacity of ECs to enclose the islets without compromising the functionality of the islets. Importantly, the MSCs stimulated EC sprout formation not only into the surrounding matrices, but also into the islets where intraislet capillary-like structures were formed. negative for CD14, CD34, and CD45) and were used from passage 3-9 (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Potential EC contamination of the MSC population was assessed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) (n ϭ 3). The cells were stained for CD90 (1:100; BD Bioscience Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), the EC pan marker CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson), and the lectin Ulex europeaus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1, 1:100; Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, U.K.). Human dermal microvascular ECs HDMECs (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) derived from adult dermis were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated flasks in EC Growth Medium Microvascular with supplements (EC medium; PromoCell). The ECs were used from passage 3-12. Cell labeling. MSCs and ECs were labeled using CellTracker (CT) green and CT orange CMRA, respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Thymidine assay and coculture of cells. Thymidine assays were performed according to a standard proliferation protocol measuring [ 3 H]thymidine (1Ci/ml) incorporation (16). ECs were plated in 24-well plates, with 25 ϫ 10 3 cells/well in EC medium with supplements for 24 h and then cultured in EC medium without supplements but containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (starvation medium) for an additional 24 h (basal control) or stimulated with either VEGF-A (20 ng/ml; Peprotech, London, U.K.) in starvation medium or MSCconditioned medium (supernatant from 24-h MSC cultures in starvation medium). [ 3 H]thymidine incorporation (at 20 -24 h) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Triplicate samples were assayed in three individual experiments. A mixture of 25 ϫ 10 3 CT green-labeled MSCs and 25 ϫ 10 3 CT orange-labeled ECs were cocultured in eight-well glass culture slides (Becton Dickinson) with EC medium and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after 3 days. Coating of islets of Langerhans with ECs and MSCs. Islets of Langerhans (10,000 -30,000 islet equivalents) were incubated within 2-5 days after isolation with 0.5 ϫ 10 6 CT orange-labeled ECs (EC islets) or with 0.25 ϫ 10 6 CT green-labeled MSCs in combination with 0.25 ϫ 10 6 CT orange-labeled ECs (EC-MSC islets) in a total volume of 500 l. The cell suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 2-3 h in suspension culture tubes in EC medium and mixed gently twice per hour during the incubation. Thereafter, the EC islets, EC-MSC islets, and untreated control islets were cultured for up to 6 days at 37°C in EC medium or islet medium (CMRL; Invitrogen) until analyzed. The medium was changed every second day. Quantification of EC adherence was performed on EC islets and EC-MSC islets after 1 and 4 days of culture. In vitro islet survival assay and cytokine and insulin content determination. A total of 100 islets per donor (n ϭ 6) were hand picked: 50 islets were coated with 5 ϫ 10 3 MSCs and 5 ϫ 10 3 ECs, and 50 islets were untreated. All islets were cultured for 6 days in EC medium, with a medium change every second day. The number of remaining islets in the respective groups were counted after 1, 3, and 6 days of culture, and the islet number was confirmed after 6 days by dithizone staining (18). Control and EC-MSC islets were collected after 6 days of culture. Total DNA (Picogreen; Invitrogen), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 (R&D Systems, Oxford, U.K.), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), tissue factor (TF) (Imubind; American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT), and insulin (Mercodia) contents were measured on a Gyrolab workstation (Gyros, Uppsala, Sweden), and the values were divided with total DNA. Four or more different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Dynamic perifusion. The functionality of the islets coated with EC-MSC and of untreated islets from the same isolation was tested at different time points after coating (at 24 h and day 3-4). EC medium was used during the first 24 h of suspension culture; thereafter, the medium was changed to islet medium with supplements (17). Islets were challenged in a dynamic perifusion system, beginning with a low glucose concentration (1.67 mmol/l) during the first 36 min, followed by a high-glucose challenge (20 mmol/l) for 42 min, then reexposure to the low glucose concentration during the last 48 min. Fractions were collected at 6-min intervals over 126 min and analyzed for insulin content using commercial ELISA kits (Mercodia Insulin ELISA; Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The area under the curve was calculated to evaluate the insulin secretion during high glucose stimulation with subtracted basal insulin secretion. Four different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Fibrin gel in vitro angiogenesis assay. Control, EC, and EC-MSC islets were placed between two layers of fibrin gel (2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen and 2 g/ml thrombin; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After polymerization, EC medium supplemented with VEGF (30 ng/ml; Peprotech) was added. The islet preparations (n ϭ 6) were cultured for 24 h, 48 h, and 3-4 days and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Sprouts were counted manually by the same person (blinded to the composition of the islet preparation), and 4 -20 islets were counted per group in each experiment. The EC sprout length was measured using Leica Qwin software (Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany) on pictures taken on day 4 of EC and EC-MSC islets in fibrin gel. The total EC sprout length per islet was calculated for each experiment (groups of 2-10 islets, n ϭ 6). The mean total sprout length per islet for all the experiments (n ϭ 6) was then calculated. The frequencies of the various sprout types were calculated by analyzing micrographs of EC-MSC islets from the fibrin gel experiments (n ϭ 6). Immunohistochemical staining. Composite and control islets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed in PBS, and incubated in 20% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4°C, then embedded in optimal cutting temperature medium (Tissue Tech; Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands), frozen, cryosectioned, and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using guinea pig anti-human insulin (1:400; Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor 488 -conjugated mouse anti-human CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson). Counterstaining was performed with DAPI (10 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Production of DsRed-expressing lentiviral particles and lentiviral vector infection of ECs. Stocks of Discosoma species-derived red fluorescent (DsRed)-expressing lentiviral vectors (Lv-DsRed) were produced by cotransfection of three plasmids, the viral core packaging construct pCMVdeltaR8.74, the VSV-G envelope protein vector pMDG.2, and the transfer vector pRRLsinPPThCMV-MCS-wpre containing DsRed cDNA (a gift of W.T. Hendriks), into human embryonic kidney 293T cells as previously described (19,20).
HDMECs at passage 3 were seeded onto 1% gelatin-coated six-well plates (1 ϫ 10 5 cells/well; AH Diagnostics) and cultured for 48 h. Virus at a titer of 2 ϫ10 5 TU/ml Lv-DsRed was added to the subconfluent cells in combination with 2 g/ml Sequa-Brene (Sigma-Aldrich) in EC medium. The plate was spun for 60 min during the Lv-DsRed infection of the ECs, and, thereafter, additional fresh medium was added to the cells. The DsRed ECs were then used in the long-term islet culture experiments according to the previously described protocol for coating of islets. Image analysis and quantification. Coating, morphology, and sprout analyses were performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss International, Oberkochen, Germany) and/or fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Elipse E600, Nikon TS100; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Confocal z-stack images composed of 10 pictures were merged to produce a picture for use in analyzing EC adherence. Micrographs were analyzed usingLeica Qwin software (Leica microsystems) to determine the surface area and total sprout length. The frequency of particular types of sprout composition was calculated from pictures using Adobe Photoshop software. Quantification of islet number was accomplished by the use of a stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems), and pictures were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop software. Ingrowth of DsRed ECs into the islets was evaluated using confocal microscopy z-stack images, visualizing ECs at a defined depth of 30 m into the islets after 3 or 6 days of culture, with a majority of samples being analyzed after 6 days. A defined distance of 30 m from the islet surface was chosen to yield good confocal resolution. The presence of ECs was scored as 0 -3, with 0 indicating the absence of ECs from the islet section and scores of 1-3 indicating a scarce (1), intermediate (2), or abundant (3) amount of ECs present. Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means Ϯ SEM. Mean values were compared using a two-tailed Wilcoxon test for paired data, with significance set at P Յ 0.05.
