We use several approaches to estimate the interval censoring model. The dependent variable in each case is the natural logarithm of annual taxable earnings, and the explanatory variables are race, level of education, age and agesquared. Table 1 presents the estimation results for the race and education coefficients based on the various estimators. The first column, headed OLS1, contains the ordinary least squares estimates based on all of the data. The second column, headed OLS2, presents the least squares results using only the observations that are not censored. The third column contains the Tobit maximum likelihood estimates under the assumption that the errors are normally distributed and homoskedastic. The remaining columns present the results for the three semiparametric estimators: CLAD, SCLS and ICLAD. The Tobit, CLAD and SCLS estimators were implemented using the Stata software package, while the ICLAD estimator was calculated using the Gauss package. For each estimator, we have created Stata "ado" files that are available at ͗http://elsa.berkeley.edu/ϳkenchay͘. 8 It is clear from Table 1 that the least squares and maximum likelihood estimates of the black-white log-earnings gap and the returns to education are extremely biased when compared to the semiparametric estimators. We think of the CLAD estimator as the natural benchmark, since it is consistent under the normality of errors assumption justifying the maximum likelihood estimator, under the independence of errors assumption justifying the ICLAD estimator, and under the conditional symmetry of errors assumption justifying the SCLS estimator. When compared to the CLAD benchmark, the least squares estimator based on all of the data (OLS1) actually does better than the maximum likelihood estimator. For this application, it appears that misspecifying the errors as being normally distributed and using maximum likelihood estimation results in more biased estimates than ignoring the censoring problem entirely and using least squares estimation. A more formal test of the normality assumption also suggests that it is violated for the log-earnings model. 9 There are sizeable differences in the estimated effects of education on earnings across the three semiparametric estimators. While the ICLAD and SCLS estimators of the education premium are similar, they are always greater than the CLAD estimator. These differences are significant given the precision of the estimates and range from 17 percent to 43 percent for the ICLAD estimator and 9 Chay and Honoré (1998) calculate the test statistics for nonnormality and for heteroskedasticity in censored regression models discussed by Chesher and Irish (1987). The test statistic for detecting nonnormality ranges from 900.47 to 1200.68. Under the null, this statistic has an (asymptotic) 2 (2) distribution with a 1 percent critical value of 9.21. Therefore, we easily reject the hypothesis that the errors are normally distributed. The test for heteroskedasticity yields statistics between 84.71 and 90.85. Under the null, these have (asymptotic) 2 (12) distributions with a 1 percent critical value of 26.22. We therefore also reject the null of no heteroskedasticity.20 percent to 33 percent for the SCLS estimator. The differences in the estimates of the black-white earnings gap are smaller, with the CLAD estimator about 11 percent to 28 percent and 4 percent to 18 percent smaller in magnitude than the ICLAD and SCLS estimators, respectively. Strikingly, the semiparametric approaches all result in more precise estimates of the race coefficient than maximum likelihood estimation. For example, the standard errors of the CLAD estimator are 25 percent to 55 percent smaller than the standard errors of the Tobit estimator. 10 The differences in the coefficient estimates across the various estimators can be used as a sort of specification check, similar in spirit to the Newey (1987) specification analysis mentioned earlier. For the education coefficient, the large differences between the maximum likelihood and semiparametric estimates suggest that nonnormal errors are an important source of bias in the Tobit estimator. Further, the significant differences among the semiparametric estimates imply that heteroskedasticity and asymmetry of the errors are also sources of misspecification in the maximum likelihood estimator of the education premium. Conversely, for the black-white earnings gap, the smaller differences among the semiparametric estimates suggest that nonnormality is the biggest source of bias in the Tobit estimator, with heteroskedasticity and asymmetry playing smaller roles.
