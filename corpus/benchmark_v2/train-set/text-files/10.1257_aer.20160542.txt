The data collection effort is unprecedented in scope and size, and was carried out as part of the BPP. I first selected the retailers to be sampled by focusing on the top 20 companies by market shares in each country that sell both online and offline (" multi-channel"), and have product barcodes that can be matched across samples. Next, I used crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Elance, and UpWork to hire 323 workers to collect the offline data. Each worker was assigned a simple task: to scan the barcodes and collect prices for a random set of 10 to 50 products in any physical store of a given retailer. In some cases they had to return to the same store multiple times to scan the same set of products. Using a special app for android phones developed to simplify and standardize the data collection process, these workers scanned each product's barcode, manually entered the price, took a photo of the price tag, and sent all the information via e-mail to the BPP servers, where it was automatically processed and cleaned. A scraping software then used the barcode numbers to look for the same product in the website of each retailer, and collected the online price within a period of seven days. The matched online-offline dataset contains prices for more than 24,000 products and 38,000 observations sampled between December 2014 and March 2016.
Collecting prices offline is normally an expensive and complicated process. NSOs rely on a large number of trained data collectors to do it correctly. Unfortunately, the micro data collected by NSOs for CPI purposes cannot be used for my comparisons because the retailer and product details are confidential information. Lacking the budget for a traditional data collection effort, I looked for alternatives using new technologies. In particular, I relied on popular crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Elance, and UpWork, to find people willing to do simple data collection tasks. To minimize the chance of data-entry errors, I developed a custom mobile phone app that simplified the data collection process.
The mobile app was custom-built to simplify and standardize the data collection process. It is an app for android phones called "BPP @ MIT," available for download at the Google Play Store. 6 Every time a worker visits a store, she clicks on a button to open a new file. For the first product, she has to enter the store's name, zip code, and country. Then she scans the UPC barcode of the product (or the barcode on the price tag, depending on the particular retailer instructions provided), manually enters the price shown in the price tag next to the product (including all sales), marks the price as "regular" or "sale," and takes a photograph of the price tag (which is used to detect errors and validate the data). All products are scanned in a loop which makes the process quick and simple. When done, the worker taps an icon to e-mail the data to the BPP servers. A member of the BPP team verifies the submitted data and pays the worker. 5 I tried to conduct a similar large-scale offline data collection with MIT students in the Boston area in 2011, but most of them were asked to stop and leave the stores after some time. Collecting data this way appears to be easier now that more people use smartphones inside stores. Indeed, Fitzgerald (2013) reports that the fear of showrooming has faded for many US retailers. See Balakrishnan, Sundaresan, and Zhang (2013) for an economic analysis of showrooming practices. 6 See https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mit.bpp. The app can be downloaded for free, but a "project code" must be requested from the BPP team. This code is used to separate the data from different projects. See http://bpp.mit.edu/ offline-data-collection/ for more details.Notes: These retailers satisfy three conditions. First, they are in the list of top 20 retailers by market share in their respective countries according to Euromonitor International. Second, they sell both online through a country-specific website and offline through physical stores. Third, there is a way to perfectly match products online and offline for the price comparison. See the online Appendix for more detailed characteristics and results.
