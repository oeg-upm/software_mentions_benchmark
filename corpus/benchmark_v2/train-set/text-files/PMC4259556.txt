Using the available raw data (from the identified studies), a Bayesian NMA was performed for the purpose of yielding probabilistic conclusions. It was possible to determine estimates for both relative effect sizes and rank probabilities through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation sampling using an R package called gemtc. The pairwise estimates are available in Table 1. Based on this table, hysterectomy is the treatment yielding the greatest reduction of patients' dissatisfaction regarding heavy menstrual bleeding, with the remaining three treatments relatively indistinguishable. These estimates are very similar to their findings despite the methods applied.
