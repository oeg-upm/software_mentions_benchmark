Litigation data. The patent litigation data set was compiled by Lanjouw and Schankerman (2001, 2004). This data set matches litigated patents identified from the Lit-Alert database with information on the progress or resolution of suits from the court database organized by the Federal Judicial Center. The data set contains 14,169 patent cases filed during the period 1975-2000. For each of these case filings, the data set reports detailed information on the main patent litigated, the patentee, the infringer, and the court dealing with the case. The data set contains information on patent cases filed in U.S. federal district courts (and not on appeal). For each patent in our data, we identify the suits in which the patent was involved and the year in which the case was filed. 12 litigation denoted by θ i . Moreover, patent transactions characterized by large enforcement gains will reallocate the patent to owners with large θ i . Thus, in a generalized version of our model, we would expect to find that ex ante infringement β i is less likely when ex post enforcement gains are larger. 10 We also dropped records in which the buyer and seller are the same entity and in which the execution date is either before the application date or after patent expiration. For additional details on the procedure, see Serrano (2010). 11 Specifically, for each transfer between a seller i and buyer j, we identified all the patents that list the seller i as the (primary) inventor and checked whether any of these patents was assigned to the buyer j at its grant date. We drop all such transactions. 12 The use of reassignment data as a proxy for activity in the market for innovation can be problematic, because technology can be transferred through patent licensing without changes in ownership. This concern is less relevant in Tax data. Information on state and federal income and capital gains taxes is obtained from the NBER Tax Rates database. This contains marginal income tax rates by year and state for a representative household with $500,000 of wage income. 13 The data set also reports maximum federal and state long-term capital gains tax rates by year and state, computed using the NBER TAXSIM model. We obtain information on the maximum federal and state corporate marginal tax rates, for each year and state, from two government publications: the Significant Features of Fiscal Federalism, available for the period 1982-1995 (American Council on Intergovernmental Relations, 1982-1995) and the Book of the States, for the period 1996-2000 (Council of State Governments, 1996-2000). For each assigned patent in our data set, we use the ordinary income and capital gains marginal tax rates in the state of the initial patent assignee. For unassigned patents, we used the state of the primary inventor as identified by the USPTO. To measure tax rates faced by potential corporate buyers, we construct a weighted average of state corporate taxes where state weights are determined by the fraction of state patent applications in the technology class of the patent. 14 Matching data on income and capital gains taxes to patents is meaningful as long as the patent is owned by an individual at the time of the transaction. To ensure this, we focus our analysis on the first transfer of a patent. Subsequent owners are generally not individuals and thus are not subject to either personal income or capital gains taxation on the patent transaction. Focusing on the first transfer involves dropping very few patent trades. Most of the traded patents in our data are traded only once (94.9%), and only 0.15% of traded patents are traded more than three times.
In principle, exploiting the information contained in the USPTO assignment data, it is possible to recover the patenting activity of the buyers in our sample. Unfortunately, the names of the buyer and seller in the Patent Assignment database were never standardized by the USPTO. Therefore, to back out buyer patent portfolios, we need to match each buyer name manually with a unique assignee identifier required to identify the buyer's patents. Because of the large size of our sample (17,605 traded patents), we manually matched only patents that were both traded and litigated at least once in their lifetime (569 patents). In the empirical analysis below, we will focus on regression results for the entire data set (299,356 patents), but also show that the findings also our study that focuses on patent litigation, because typically it is the owner of the patent who brings patent infringement actions. Nonexclusive licensees do not have the right to sue for patent infringement (Textile Prods. v. Mead Corp., 134 F.3d 1481, 1485 Fed. Cir. 1998). An exclusive licensee may have standing to bring such a suit, but only under some restrictive contract arrangements (Resonant Sensors Inc. v. SRU Biosystems, Inc., no. 3:08-cv-1978-M). 13 For details, see the description of the TAXSIM program in Feenberg and Coutts (1993). The simulation and the resulting data are available at www.nber.org/∼taxsim/state-rates/. 14 All our results are robust to dropping corporate tax rates or to using corporate tax rates in the state of the inventor, which assumes that trading of patents occurs only within states. Table 1 reports summary statistics for the key variables. Table 1A shows the fraction of sample patents involved in trade or litigation at least once in their life. Of the total sample, 4.55% of patents are traded and 0.69% are involved in at least one suit. These rates are low, but it is worth noting that, for the later patents in the sample, data on trade and litigation are truncated, and this biases downward litigation and trade rates. 16 Moreover, patents that are traded or litigated are much more valuable than those that are not (as measured by citations received). 17 The striking fact from this table is the strong association between trading and litigation. Of patents that are traded, 4.2% are also litigated; for patents that are not traded, the litigation rate is only 0.51%. Of patents that are litigated, 27.9% are also traded; for patents that are not litigated, only 4.4% are traded.
Step 1. Regress each of the variables in the vector of covariates X on P using local linear regression. In our setting, this involves running multiple regressions. The regressions were run in STATA 10 using the command lpoly.
The second part of the procedure involves numerically differentiating E[L| P]. To do so, we divide observations into groups, based either on the deciles of the distribution of P or the absolute value of P. Recall that the variable component of E[L| P] with respect to P is ε( P). The mean of ε( P) was calculated for each of these groups. The derivative of ε( P) was obtained by finite differencing across neighboring groups. The confidence intervals of the marginal treatment effects were obtained using 50 bootstrap iterations (seed = 123 in STATA 10).Note: Capital gains tax rates for the period 1982-2001 are obtained from the NBER TAXSIM data set. Changes in tax rates are equal to the number of policy changes in the capital gains tax rate for the period 1982-2001. Tax Change is equal to the average tax change in percentage points (or growth rates) among all the changes in the capital gains tax rate in a state. U.S. states with zero tax changes in the state-level capital gains tax rate are states with no state level capital gains tax rate (e.g., Florida). The row labeled "average" is the average across U.S. states. U.S. states are ranked according to the number of individually owned patents granted in the state.Note: All regressions include age, period, and patent fixed effects. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the patent level. Statistical significance: * 10%, * * 5%, * * * 1%. NewOwner = 1 when the patent changes ownership for the first time and remains equal to one for the remaining life of the patent. Time period dummies: before 1986, 1986-1990, 1991-995, and after 1995. P is the estimated probability of not being owned by the original inventor.Note: Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at patent level. All regressions include age, period, and patent fixed effects. Statistical significance: * 10%, * * 5%, * * * 1%. Litigation dummy = 1 if the patent is involved in at least one case at that age; NewOwner = 1 when the patent changes ownership for the first time, and remains equal to one for the remaining life of the patent. Time period dummies: before 1986, 1986-1990, 1991-1995, after 1995. In columns 2-4, LargeBuyer = 1 if the acquirer obtained more than eight patents in the 20 years before trade. In columns 1 and 2, TechFit = 1 if acquired patent belongs to technology subcategory in which buyer has more patents. In column 3, TechFit constructed using USPTO patent n classes. In column 4, TechFit = 1 if either the acquired patent cites one of the patents of the buyer or if the patents of the buyer cite the acquired patent. NewOwner and its interactions are instrumented by the probit estimates of the probability of not being owned by the original inventor.
