Given our focus on aggregate data, our hypothesis and argumentation is somewhat different. To the extent that BITs act as a means of substituting for weak domestic institutions in the host, then we would expect that multinational firms concerned about weak domestic institutions would not invest (or would withdraw previous investments) in that country without the protection of a BIT. 15 For more information on the difference between these estimators, see Wooldridge (2002) and the Stata help file for psmatch2. 16 In particular, this gives an estimate of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), which in our case gives the expected impact of new-BIT membership on FDI flows for a randomly drawn country-pair in the subsample of countrypairs that actually entered into a BIT agreement. Note that the ATT can be obtained from a weighted least squares regression, where the weights for the untreated observations correspond to the weights used in the construction of the control group. 17 Myburgh and Paniagua (2016) use a similar approach and find a BIT reduces (raises) FDI levels below (above) the median.
