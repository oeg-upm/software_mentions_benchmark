Despite these caveats and inherent uncertainty about the superiority of the bootstrap in specific settings, the availability of powerful desktop computers makes widespread use of the bootstrap very tempting. Bootstrap estimates-especially based on the paired approach-are trivial to obtain once the estimation model is specified. The statistical package Stata has several bootstrap procedures and subroutines available in its core program, and a researcher who has never read a single 5 Other useful cross-section applications, surveyed in Brownstone and Kazimi (2000), include quantile regression, discrete choice and hazard models, and frontier production function estimates. 6 Bickel and Freedman (1983) provided an early example of model-based bootstrapping for time series. Their approach has been generalized to autoregressive moving average models (Berkowitz and Kilian, 2000; Li and Maddala, 1996) and cointegrated regression models (Li and Maddala, 1997). Kilian (1998a, b) considers bootstrapping vector autoregression models and applies this technique to examine international effects of monetary policy. word about the bootstrap could produce bootstrapped estimates in Stata with little difficulty. Researchers should be cautious about such casual application, because results regarding the reliability and accuracy of bootstrapped sampling distributions are not yet available for many classes of econometric models. However, while we await further results, the bootstrap can be very useful for simple applications such as estimating the sampling distributions of nonparametric statistics (for example, quantiles and percentiles of univariate distributions) or statistics with illdefined distributions (see Valletta, 1993, footnote 13, for an example).
