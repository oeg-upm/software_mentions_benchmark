For insulin stimulation, insulin was administered intravenously 5 min before the mice were killed, and livers or epididymal fat pads were immediately obtained and flash-frozen until analysis. Insulin doses of 0.5 and 2 units/kg gave identical signaling responses. LEAF-purified anti-mouse Ly-6G antibodies, LEAFpurified anti-mouse tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a antibodies (MP6-XT22), and LEAF-purified anti-mouse CD54 antibodies and their isotype control IgG antibodies (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) were used for neutrophil depletion, TNF-a neutralization, and ICAM-1 neutralization, respectively. Immunoblot analysis. Epididymal fat pads were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer exactly as done earlier (9). Samples underwent 7.5% SDS-PAGE (for each 100-mg sample). The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with goat anti-mouse MPO (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-mouse b-actin (1:10,000), anti-phosphorylated (p)-Ser473 Akt (1:1000), anti-Akt (1:1000), anti-p-Ser9 glycogen synthase kinase (GSK; 1:1000), anti-GSK (1:1000), anti-cPLA 2 a (1:200; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX; 1:1000; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), or anti-cyclogenase-2 (COX-2; 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.). After being washed with TBS-T (four washes for 15 min each), the membranes were incubated with 1:10,000 dilutions of the respective horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature. Proteins were quantified using video densitometry analysis (ImageGauge version 4.0, Fuji), as described previously (19,20). Preparation of neutrophils. Heart blood was withdrawn before mice were killed. Neutrophils, at 95% purity, were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. Cells were counted, and their viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Immunohistochemistry for neutrophil detection. Epididymal fat tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned using a Leica microtome (Leica Biosystem, Vienna, Austria). Neutrophil staining by rat anti-mouse monoclonal anti-NIMP-R14 antibody to identify neutrophils (Novus Biological Inc.) was analyzed as done before (9,13), based on an earlier study (21). Nonspecific reactivity was blocked by incubating the slides with 20% normal rabbit serum for 20 min with avidin-biotin VECTA-STAIN Kit Elite PK 6105 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then incubated in 1:10 dilution of anti-NIMP-R14 antibodies in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and further incubated with 1:200 dilution of biotinylated anti-rat IgG, followed by avidin-biotin complex/HRP-DAB, which resulted in brown staining of neutrophils. For each treatment, a negative control was prepared without the primary antibody. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and analyzed in a blinded fashion using an Olympus BX-60 microscope.
