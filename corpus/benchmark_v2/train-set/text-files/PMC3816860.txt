The changes in HbA 1c from baseline to week 24 were assessed using ANCOVA, with treatment, study, and washout as fixed classification effects and baseline HbA 1c as a covariate. The same model with the addition of the covariate baseline FPG was used to assess changes in FPG from baseline to week 24. The reductions in HbA 1c within the linagliptin group were stratified into quartiles based on the change from baseline to week 24: ,0.1, 0.120.59, 0.6020.99, and $1.0% (,1.1, 1.126.5, 6.6210.8, and $10.9 mmol/mol). Effects on SBP after treatment within the linagliptin group were stratified into three categories based on the change from baseline to the last value on treatment: SBP decrease of .1.0 mmHg, stable SBP with only minimal changes between 21.0 and 11.0 mmHg, and SBP increase of .1.0 mmHg. The difference between percentage changes in geometric mean UACR across HbA 1c quartiles and SBP categories was tested using an ANOVA F-test to determine whether they were statistically significantly different. Safety assessments were performed on the pooled treated set. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
