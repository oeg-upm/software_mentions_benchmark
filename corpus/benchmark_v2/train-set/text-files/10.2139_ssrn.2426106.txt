Using a large number of instruments may overfit endogenous variables and may weaken the Hansen J-test of the instruments' joint validity. To keep the number of instruments at a minimum, we use the collapse option in STATA in all regressions (Roodman, 2009). 19 This ensures that the number of instruments is always well below the number of countries. Overall, the results, reported in Table 2, are broadly in line with the fixed-effects results. The lagged dependent variable is always significant at the one percent level. Depending on the model specification, the estimated coefficient is slightly above or below one, implying no strong evidence for convergence in sub-Saharan African countries. This finding is in line with the results of McCoskey (2002), who also found no convergence for economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, although smaller "convergence clubs" do exist.
