Concentrations of the expressed Epo protein in the supernatants were quantified by human Epo ELISA kit (CIGB, Havana, Cuba) according to the supplier instructions. Purified proteins were quantified by both ELISA and the Bradford method (17). Protein samples were analyzed by the standard Laemmli SDS-PAGE method (18) in a 12.5% separating gel and developed with silver staining. Further analysis of stained SDS-PAGE slabs for yield measurements was performed by densitometry using a GS-800 Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer and employing Quantity One analyzer according to the software manual. Western analysis was performed by electroblotting of proteins from SDS-PAGE gel to Whatman nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell).
