The zeta potential gives an indication of the charge acquired by a particulate system on its suspension in aqueous medium. The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was determined usingDTS software (Malvern Instruments Limited, Malvern, UK) based on M3-PALS technology. The concentration of the AmB−PGA formulation used was 10 -4 M. Particle size was determined by photon correlation spectroscopy (90Plus/BI-MAS, Brookhaven Instruments, Holtville, NY, USA). Samples were filtered using a 0.22 µm syringe filter (polyethersulfone, Millipore) to remove contamination with dust particles. Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out using DynaPro-TC-04 equipment (Protein Solutions, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) equipped with a temperature-controlled microsampler. The size and surface morphology of the AmB-loaded nanoparticles were characterized using an electron microscope (CM-10, Philips, Hamburg, Germany). For transmission electron microscopy studies, the AmB−PGA formulation was used at a concentration of 10 µg/mL AmB equivalents in double-distilled water. The details of these procedures are provided in the Supplementary materials section.
In order to assess the statistical differences among various groups, the data were analyzed using the Student's t-test and one way analysis of variance (Holm-Sidak method), using Sigma-Plot version 10 software. P-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was determined usingDTS software (Malvern Instruments Limited, Malvern, UK) based on M3-PALS technology. Samples were filtered using a 0.22 µm polyethersulfone syringe filter (Millipore, Bangalore, India) to remove contamination with dust particles. The formulation was lyophilized in a 2.0 mL microfuge tube and the samples were reconstituted in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). This dispersion was then rapidly dispensed to an electrophoresis cell to measure the electrophoretic mobility, and zeta potential values were calculated. The concentration of the AmB−PGA formulation used was 10 -4 M. The experiments were repeated three times and the average zeta potential and standard deviations
Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out using DynaPro-TC-04 equipment (Protein Solutions, Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) equipped with a temperature-controlled microsampler. The PGA nanoparticles (2 mg/mL) were filtered serially through 0.22 µm and 0.02 µm Whatman syringe filters directly into a 12 µL quartz cuvette. For each experiment, 20 measurements were taken. Mean hydrodynamic radius (R h ) was analyzed using Dynamics software at optimized resolution. The R h was estimated on the basis of an autocorrelation analysis of
