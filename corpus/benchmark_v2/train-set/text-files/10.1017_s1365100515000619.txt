For the estimation and simulation, I do a Bayesian estimation. I execute the Bayesian estimation in Dynare version 4.2.2. Readers who are interested in the details of the estimation are referred to Griffoli's (2007-2008) Dynare User Guide.
One thing that I should note here is that this version of Dynare does not allow the higher-order approximation of the model for the estimation. However, it is well known that log linearization is good enough if the main focus of the research is not on welfare analysis or investigation of the financial market but on examining the business cycle. Table 2 reports the parameter values, both calibrated and estimated from the Bayesian estimation. The model data are simulated 300,000 times. The measurement equations for Y t , C t , I t , and TBY t are given by
