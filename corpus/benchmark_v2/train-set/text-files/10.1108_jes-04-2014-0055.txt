Next, we calculate the inequality based on the parameter sets we obtained above. Here we use the best and weighted average parameter sets in bootstrap to calculate individuals' welfare without discretizing them, and then we calculate Theil's first and second indices and generalized entropy index with γ ¼ −1/2 using R package "ineq." Here we use generalized entropy index with γ ¼ −1/2 because the metric entropy measure we use is the same entropy metric with γ ¼ −1/2. The results are in Table VII. The second column is the inequality in reported happiness, where happiness is a discrete variable. The third and fourth columns are inequality of welfare S calculated through the best and weighted average parameter sets in the bootstrap, using metric entropy measure 1. The fifth and sixth columns are inequality of welfare S calculated through the best and weighted average parameter sets in the bootstrap, using metric entropy measure 2. The results for discrete individual welfare are in Table VIII. When we analyze inequality results, we should focus more on results from metric entropy measure 2 because it focusses on the similarity of two distributions. It is interesting to note from Tables VII and VIII, that inequality in self-reported "happiness" is always higher than that in multidimensional welfare based on entropy metric 2. One possible explanation is that this is due to the
