Strain identification by MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA sequencing Among the 18 culture conditions previously selected by culturomics [27], strain MC1 grew on sheep's blood-enriched Colombia agar (bioMÃ©rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The colonies were obtained by spreading samples on a solid medium. They were then purified by subculture and identified by MALDI-TOF MS [28,29]. Colonies were deposited in duplicate on a MTP 96 MALDI-TOF MS target plate (Bruker Daltonics, Leipzig, Germany), which was analysed with a Microflex spectrometer (Bruker). The 12 spectra obtained were matched against the references of the 7567 bacteria contained in the database by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings), with MALDI BioTyper database software 2.0 (Bruker). An identification score over 1.9 with a validated species allows identification at the species level, and a score under 1.7 does not enable any identification. When identification by MALDI-TOF MS failed, the 16S rRNA was sequenced [30]. Stackebrandt and Ebers [31] suggest similarity levels of 98.7% with the 16S rRNA sequence as a threshold to define a new species without performing DNA-DNA hybridization.
ORFans were identified if all the performed BLASTP procedures did not give positive results (E value smaller than 1e-03 for ORFs with sequence size higher than 80 aa or E value smaller than 1e-05 for ORFs with a sequence length smaller than 80 aa). Such parameter thresholds have already been used in previous work to define ORFans. Genomes were automatically retrieved from the 16s RNA tree using Xegen's PhyloPattern software [37]. For each selected genome, complete genome sequence, proteome andORFeome genome sequence were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information FTP site. All proteomes were analysed with proteinOrtho [38]. Then for each couple of genomes a similarity score was computed. This score is the mean value of nucleotide similarity between all orthologue couples between the two genomes studied (AGIOS) [26]. The entire proteome was annotated to define the distribution of functional classes of predicted genes according to the clusters of orthologous protein groups (using the same method as for the genome annotation). To evaluate the genomic similarity among the compared strains, we determined two parameters: digital DNA-DNA hybridization, which exhibits a high correlation with DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) [39,40], and AGIOS [26], which was designed to be independent from DDH.
