Statistics: Arithmetic mean and standard deviation were used to present data. One-way ANOVA and Tukey test for multiple comparisons were conducted with Optical Density (OD) readings of sera from infected and treated mice from different groups, and two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post test were used to compare larval recovery in tissues using the Prisma program, version 5.0. Differences were considered to be significant when p < 0.05.
