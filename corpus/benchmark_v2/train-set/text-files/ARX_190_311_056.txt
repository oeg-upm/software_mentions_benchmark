We demonstrate that a very simple user-level program [55, 3] can reliably and consistently induce RowHammer errors in commodity AMD and Intel systems using vulnerable DRAM modules. We released the source code of this program [3], which Google Project Zero later enhanced [4]. Using our user-level RowHammer program, we showed that both read and write accesses to memory can induce bit flips, all of which occur in rows other than the one that is being accessed.
