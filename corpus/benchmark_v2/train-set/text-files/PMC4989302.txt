For the bioinformatics analyses, we used a standardised pipeline including (i) quality filtering, (ii) clustering and (iii) taxonomy annotation. Low-quality tails were removed from the reads and trimmed reads with an average Phred quality score less than 25 were discarded. Additionally, we removed all reads with at least one base with a quality of less than 15 and also all reads that contained errors in the primer regions. Multiplex Identifiers were used to separate the different samples. Chimeras were removed using UCHIME (USEARCH v.6) (Edgar et al., 2011). Subsequently, the sequences that passed the quality filtering were clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with UCLUST version 6 (Edgar, 2010) at 97% sequence identity for further analyses. Sequences were sorted by abundance beforehand clustering and clustering was performed for all sequences of all sampling campaigns at a time (that is, not individually by campaigns). For all OTUs, we used BLASTn version 2.2.25+ (Altschul et al., 1990) with the nucleotide collection database nr/nt and the NCBI Taxonomy Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ taxonomy; RefSeq Release 57 (14 January 2013)) to annotate the OTUs with taxonomic information. For reasons of comparison, we also processed our data with the CANGS pipeline (Pandey et al., 2010) and received similar results.
