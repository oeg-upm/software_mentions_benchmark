The data was entered in a MS-Excel database and was analysed using stata 13.1 statistical software (Stata, College Station, Texas USA). We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the independent effects of serum UA, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C before and after adjusting for the possible confounding factors on maternal and fetal outcomes. The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, birth weight, gestational age of delivery and mode of delivery were treated as the dependent variables and serum UA, serum creatinine and serum cystatin C as independent variables. Both dependent and independent variables were dichotomized. Hypertension, birth weight and gestational age of delivery were dichotomized using the standard cut-off values. 3,17,18 The cut-offs for dichotomization were taken as 5.88 mg/dl for serum uric acid, 19 0.8 mg/dl for serum creatinine 16 and 1.3 mg/L for serum cystatin c. 16 Serum uric acid ≥ 5.88 mg/dl, serum creatinine ≥ 0.8 mg/dl and serum cystatin C ≥ 1.3 mg/L were coded as 1 and those less than the cut-offs were coded as 0. For each outcome the first model was unadjusted and the second model was adjusted for the covariates as possible confounders in the analysis. The possible confounders were age, BMI, gestational age, parity and birth weight in the first analysis where hypertensive disorders were taken as the dependent variable (Table 2); age, BMI, gestational age, parity and hypertensive disorders in the second analysis where birth weight was taken as the dependent variable (Table 3); age, BMI, parity, birth weight and hypertensive disorders in the third analysis where the gestational age of delivery is the outcome Table 4); age, BMI, parity, birth weight, gestational age and hypertensive disorders in the fourth analysis where mode of delivery was taken as the dependent variable (Table 5). A p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
