The quantitative degree of bone regeneration was analyzed based on the virtual slices taken from the serial slice image segmentation every 8 µm from the cross-sectional images of the 3D reconstructions along the longitudinal direction.The resulting images are a map of the local X-ray attenuation coefficient plus the enhanced boundaries made by the interference of transmitting coherent X-rays. In the images, the newly formed bone fragments were clearly distinguished from the Bio-Oss ® in the gray level. Image analysis software (Amira Version 5.5; FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, USA) was used for 3D visualization. The slice images were noise filtered and then smoothed using the edge-preserving-smoothing function of the software. Segmentation was carried out based on the difference in the gray level between the Bio-Oss ® and the newly formed bone and the volume was calculated by counting the number of voxels belonging to each material. At each slice, the measurements were performed to calculate the percentage (ie, area fraction) of mineralized bone, residual graft material, and soft tissue components.
