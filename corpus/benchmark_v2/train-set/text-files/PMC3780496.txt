Construct validity was determined by examining the gaps in the measurement of each item's calibration value. Z-test analysis was used to determine the significance of gaps. The presence of significant gaps indicates that some domains of the job satisfaction construct are not assessed. 25 Reliability refers to the level of true and error variance in an observed score. The Rasch person reliability index denotes the reproducibility of person placement across other items measuring the same construct, which is equivalent to the Cronbach's alpha (test reliability) in classical test theory. 22,23,26 An overall score of job satisfaction among community pharmacists in Tucson was calculated converting the ordinal responses from the WarrCook-Wall questionnaire to interval data (logits) with the Rasch Model if the Rasch model's requirements mentioned above were met. A higher score in logits represents greater job satisfaction (logits typically ranges from -4 to 4). The Rasch overall score was used as a continuous variable in descriptive, and non-parametric bivariate analyses to explore differences in job satisfaction and age, type of degree (PharmD/Non-PharmD), years of experience, workload (Avg. prescription volume/week, and whether they worked more than 36 hours/week), type of pharmacy chain (Grocery/non-grocery), having experience outside of community practice (yes/no), provision of patient care services at the pharmacy (yes/no) and job position (Pharmacist in charge yes/no) the selection of these variables was based on previous studies. 15 Statistical significance was set at 0.05. The statistical software used were Winsteps for Rasch analyses and STATA 11.
