where we only observe C if = I (C * if > 0). We estimate Eq. 6 using STATA's xtlogit command. The variance components σ 2 e and σ 2 a are estimated using maximum likelihood. The random family effect is estimated conditional on the random individual effect being logistically distributed with mean zero, variance σ 2 e = π 2 /3 and independent of a f . Inspired by the approach used in Mazumder (2008) and Björklund et al. (2010), we then go on to include potentially important family-wide variables, either one at a time or simultaneously, in the x if matrix. For example, consider the inclusion of parental income and education in x if . These additional control variables should reduce the residual variation in the outcome variable and produce a lower estimate of the between-family variation, σ a 2 * , than the estimate produced without the added controls. Abstracting from measurement error, we can interpret the difference between these two estimates, σ a 2 − σ a 2 * , as an upper bound on the amount of the variance in the family component that can be explained by parental income and education. It is viewed as an upper bound since it includes other factors that are correlated with parental income and education. 10 9 Björklund and Jäntti (2012) discuss this issue in great detail and provide quantitative examples of its importance. 10 In the presence of measurement error, this difference, σ 2 a − σ 2 * a , is more correctly viewed as a downwardly biased estimate of the upper bound on the amount of the variance in the family component that can be accounted for by parental income and education. This experiment also produces a new sibling correlation ρ * . From what we know about the relationship between parents' income and education and children's crime (see, e.g., Hjalmarsson and Lindquist 2012), we expect this new sibling correlation to be lower but still substantial in magnitude.
Once again, x in allows for the inclusion of multiple control variables. Note that the family component, a f , is now subsumed by the individual component, e in . To net out sorting into neighborhoods (i.e., to remove the covariance term), we include controls for parents' income, education and criminality, and family structure in x in . 11 We also include gender and birth year dummies. 12 11 Sorting on unobservables may also occur. To the extent that these unobservable characteristics are uncorrelated with our control variables, they will bias our estimated neighborhood correlations upwards. 12 In practice, we estimate neighborhood correlations after first randomly drawing one child from each family. We do this, so that large families living in small neighborhoods will not dominate the estimation. Alternatively, one could estimate neighborhood, family, and individual variance components simultaneously by applying STATA's xtmelogit to the whole sample and estimating a model with three levels. But due to our large sample, our use of control variables, and the large number of correlations that we need to calculate in this paper, this approach becomes infeasible; running time and convergence become problematic. In some cases, we have used both methods and the answer does not change. The fact that we randomly sample one child from each family does not seem to matter much either.
The intensive margin correlations are computed using binary outcome variables. 21 For crime, we have constructed binary outcome variables taking the value 1 if an individual has committed at least x crimes (where x is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 crimes). For prison sentence length, we have constructed binary outcome variables indicating if an individual has spent a total of at least x months in prison (where x isSibling correlations are estimated using STATA's xtlogit command. All outcome variables are dichotomous. Birth year and gender dummies are included. Standard errors are in parentheses. Singletons are included, except in the estimation of the mixed siblings. Estimates are not sensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of singletons equal to 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 12 months). We show the intensive margin correlations in Fig. 1 along with approximate 95 % confidence intervals. The trend line in Fig. 1 is upward sloping for sibling correlations in crime. This means that factors shared by siblings account for a larger share of the variation in crime at the intensive margin. For instance, for sisters, the share of the variation that can be attributed to factors shared by siblings is more than twice as high for "at least 10 crimes" than for "at least 1 crime."
The results estimated from Eqs. 9 and 10 are reported in the first two columns of Table 4 for all crime. Having an older sibling who is convicted of at least one crime in year t − 1 raises the younger sibling's odds of receiving at least one conviction in 30 Schrøter Joensen and Skyt Nielsen (2015) report a causal influence of older male siblings' choice of academic curricula on their younger male siblings' choice of academic curricula. 31 None of the results in the section change if we, instead, use the number of convictions each year, that is if we instead create a panel of annual intensive margin variables.Odds ratios (OR) are estimated using logistic regressions. Standard errors clustered on individuals, i.e., the younger sibling, are reported in parentheses. Family background controls include parental income and education, parental criminality, and family structure (household size at age 15, unknown father, mother's age at first birth, and household type at age 15). Sibling correlations in columns (1) and (5) are estimated using STATA's xtlogit command. Sibling correlations reported in columns (2-4) are approximated using the following formula: ρ ≈ (OR φ − 1)/(OR φ + 1), where φ is calibrated using the odds ratios and sibling correlations estimated in columns (1) and (5). In the first row of sibling correlations (involving C 1 t−1 ), φ is equal to 0.82. In the second row of sibling correlations (involving C 1 t ), φ is equal to 0.76 * * * p < 0.01
The highest correlations are the correlations for property crime for men and women, which are both 0.03. These correlations indicate that at most 3 % of the variation in property crime can be attributed to shared neighborhood factors. These 36 Most Swedish studies using observational data tend to find limited influences of neighborhoods on children's outcomes (e.g., Brännström 2004 and Lindahl 2011). However, several quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated that growing up in an ethnic enclave in Sweden does have an important effect on children's outcomes (e.g., Edin et al. 2003 andÅslund et al. 2011). 37 We cannot get information on schools attended nor on the Small Area Marketing Statistics used to define neighborhoods in Sariaslan et al. (2013), since the cohorts we study are too old.Neighborhood correlations are estimated using STATA's xtlogit command after first randomly drawing one individual from each family. This random draw is done separately for each of the three sample used. All outcome variables are dichotomous. Birth year and gender dummies are included. Controls for parental education and income, parental criminality, and family structure are also included in order to net out sorting into neighborhoods. Standard errors are in parentheses should be contrasted with our brother and sister correlations in "at least one property crime," which are 0.38 and 0.34, respectively. Thus, neighborhood effects appear to be able to explain approximately 7 % of the sibling correlation in property crime at the extensive margin. Given that we have included all of the family-wide controls used in Section 5, these 7 % can be added on to the 27 % explained in the previous section. Thus, it appears that we can account for as much as one third of the sibling correlation at the extensive margin. The intensive margin neighborhood correlations are again computed using binary outcome variables. We show the neighborhood correlations for up to 10 crimes and up to 1 year in prison in Fig. 6. In Appendix Fig. 8, we show separate figures for each crime type.
