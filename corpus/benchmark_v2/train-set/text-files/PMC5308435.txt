This was derived from a MR axial dataset of the aorta at the level of the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery. The maximum and minimal cross sectional areas of the ascending and descending aorta were calculated using Art-FUN (Laboratoire d'Imagerie Biome´dicale, UPMC-CNRS-INSERM, France), an automated edgedetection software for assessment of arterial function. 9 Aortic strain was defined as: (max cross-sectional aorta area À min cross-sectional aorta area)/min cross-section aortic area. 10 Aortic distensibility (10 À3 mmHg À1 ) was defined as: aortic strain/brachial artery pulse pressure. 10 Pulse wave velocity Velocity encoded phase contrast sequences were acquired from a MR axial dataset of the aorta at the level of the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery perpendicularly transecting both the ascending and descending aorta. A non-breath-hold sequence was used and 128 phases were captured during the cardiac cycle. The transit time of the propagation of the velocity waveform was calculated between the ascending and descending aorta using the Art-FUN software with the least squares minimisation approach using all data points on the systolic upslope of the aorta flows after peak flow normalisation. 9,10 The aortic path length was calculated from the double-oblique view of the thoracic aorta. Pulse wave velocity (m/s) was derived as aortic path length divided by the transit time.
