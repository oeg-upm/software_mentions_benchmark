What remains now is to estimate the within-submarket spatial weight v 0 . Since dwellings within a submarket are in general located closer to each other than those across different submarkets, it is expected that v 0 will be large compared to the cross-submarket spatial weights. We propose maximum likelihood to conduct this estimation. Specifically, for any candidate value of v 0 , we construct the corresponding row-standardized spatial weights matrix W, estimate the spatial error model using maximum likelihood, and evaluate the value of the maximized likelihood. In this way, we construct spatial weights matrices using various candidate values for v 0 , estimate the corresponding spatial error models by maximum likelihood using Geoda (Anselin, 2005), and maximize the likelihood over all such candidate values. Standard errors are estimated by numerical approximation to compute the Fisher information at this maximized value for v 0 . 14 Finally, as discussed earlier, we use the Born & Breitung (2011) regression test to examine the validity of spatial error dependence against a hybrid model including a spatial lag.
Next, we used the GEODA software (Anselin, 2005; Anselin et al., 2006) to perform a series of Lagrange Multipliers (LM) tests (Anselin, 2005) for both spatial lag dependence and spatial error dependence. Specifically, in addition to OLS, we estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) alternative spatial regression models and investigated whether a spatial error or a spatial lag model, or indeed a model Figure 2.

We report the results for a spatial weights matrix based on rook and queen contiguity in Table 6; results for other specifications of spatial weights are similar. Like Moran's I statistics, we find no evidence of spatial dependence. This is despite the fact that we have not accounted for spatial heterogeneity in these estimates*a feature that can contribute to spatial dependence. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistics are significant neither for the spatial error (p-value 0.41) nor the spatial lag (p-value 0.77) models. The null hypothesis of both tests, which is the lack of spatial dependence, cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level.
