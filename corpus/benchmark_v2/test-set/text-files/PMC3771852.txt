All tricyclic phthalimides (1-42) were built usingSPARTAN'10 software (Wavefunction, Inc, Irvine, CA, USA) for Windows XP ® . Conformational analysis was performed with the conformer distribution Monte Carlo method, using Merck Molecular Force Field 94 (MMFF94). The lowest energy conformations were geometrically optimized by the Parameterized Model number 3 (PM3) semi-empirical method available in the program. In the absence of a compound from the phthalimide class co-crystallized with HIV-1 IN, the lowest energy conformations were used as the bioactive conformation, a methodology successfully used by other authors. 12-14 hQsar models
Conformer selection and molecular alignment are the most essential steps in 3D-QSAR studies. The accuracy and reliability of the CoMFA model is directly dependent on the molecular alignment rule. 11 In this study, the alignments were carried out using the SYBYL-X 1.1 software package (Tripos International, St Louis, MO, USA) and made based on the presence of a moiety common to all derivatives, by adopting the RMS (root mean square) atom-fit rule for superposition of individual atoms. Two different alignments were performed and three models were generated from each one. The most active compound from the series (33) was used as the template for both alignments Figure 1). In alignment I, all atoms of the tricyclic phthalimide moiety were chosen, except for the hydroxyl groups and external carbon atoms of the pyrazine ring. In alignment II, all atoms of tricyclic phthalimide moiety were chosen Figure 1).
