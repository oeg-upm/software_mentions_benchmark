The changes in levels of care needs were stratified into a lower level of care needs subgroup and a higher level of care needs subgroup based on the baseline levels of care needs. The lower level of care needs subgroup included the support level and care needs level 1. The higher level of care needs subgroup included care needs level 2, 3 and 4. Because the LTCI system was amended in April 2006 to include 7 levels instead of 6, with eligibility determined through a process of care needs certification by the municipality, those eligible were 1) persons certified before the revision as "support level" (support level 1 in the new classification) and 2) persons with a higher possibility of maintaining or improving their condition among those certified before the revision as care needs level 1 (support level 2 in the new classification) 15). SPSS 18.0J Windows was used for the statistical analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the frail persons at baseline and during the two-year follow-up period. Overall, the data showed that female subjects were nearly 65% and Table 2 shows the changes in care needs levels of frail persons with regard to utilization of in-home services. For utilization of in-home services, using of home help/bathing and day care service exhibited statistically significant results and were related to a sustained/improved level of care needs, respectively. About 78% of the subjects used home help/bathing, 71% of the subjects used day care service and 58% of the subjects were using day rehabilitation were associated with significant sustained/improved care needs levels, respectively. In contrast, about 59% of the subjects using short stays in a facility were associated with significant deteriorated care needs levels. Whereas, for 60% of the sub-jects using home-visit nursing and rental service for equipment was associated with no significant stained/improved care needs levels, respectively.
