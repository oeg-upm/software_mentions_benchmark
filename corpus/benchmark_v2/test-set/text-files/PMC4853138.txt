Biomarkers for gastric cancer diagnostics PGI/PGII ratios in the serum or plasma are indicators of atrophic gastritis, which is linked to elevated risk of gastric cancer. 12-15 H. pylori and gastric atrophy have both been identified as etiological factors for gastric cancer. H. pylori was declared as a class I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1994. 16 Epidemiological surveys support a positive association between H. pylori infection and the development of gastric cancer. 17-19 In this study, all patients and health controls had been tested for H. pylori IgG with ELISA kit (Biohit ELISA kit; Biohit, Helsinki, Finland). Intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and hemoglobin were also associated with gastric cancer development and metastasis in previous studies. 20-26 All antibodies have been validated in ELISA and were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antigen protein has been validated for ELISA too. We developed all kits for Luminex according to The Luminex Cookbook. 27 All nine protein kits were divided into a 5-plex panel and two 2-plex panels with different dilution rates for each patients' samples. All samples were randomly divided into different plates to perform the Luminex test. The random number allocation and grouping was done using STATA 12 software.
The raw data of biomarkers from Luminex combined with the H. pylori IgG concentrations were analyzed by comparison between the gastric cancer patients group and the control group using χ 2 , the z-statistic, and the Student's t-test. Further, the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and correlations between biomarkers were analyzed. The analysis of correlations between biomarkers was performed as well. For the identification of algorithms distinguishing controls from patients with gastric carcinoma, three classification analysis methods -random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression -were performed with the R program package. The R project of statistical computing (Wirtschaftsuniversität, Wien, Austria) was used for classification analysis to develop the algorithms.
