To use the Bitcoin system, an agent downloads a Bitcoin wallet. A Bitcoin wallet is software that allows the receiving, storing, and sending of (fractions of) Bitcoin units. 3 The next step is to exchange fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, for Bitcoin units. The most common way is to open an account at one of the many Bitcoin exchanges and to transfer fiat currency to it. The account holder can then use these funds to buy Bitcoin units or one of the many other cryptoassets on the exchange. Due to the widespread adoption of Bitcoin, the pricing on large exchanges is very competitive with relatively small bid-ask spreads. Most exchanges provide order books and many other financial tools that make the trading process transparent.
