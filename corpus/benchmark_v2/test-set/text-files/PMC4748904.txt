The selection of studies, collection and analysis of data, and reporting of the results obtained, followed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The Cochrane Q-statistic and the I2-statistic tests were used to assess heterogeneity among the studies whereby P 0.05 was considered statistically significant and P > 0.05 was considered statistically insignificant. I2 described the total variation (due to heterogeneity rather than chance) across studies in terms of percentages whereby a value of 0% indicated no heterogeneity, and larger values especially from 50% and above indicated increasing heterogeneity. A fixed effect model was used if I2 was <50% and a random effect model was used if I2 was >50%. Funnel plots were assessed for publication bias. Oddratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for categorical variables. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the statistical analysis. The authors had full access to and take full responsibility for the integrity of the data. All authors have read and agreed to the manuscript as written. Ethical approval was not required since this study is a systematic review and metaanalysis of RCTs. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of study selection. We identified 42 studies comparing SES with PES in patients with CAD. Thirteen studies were excluded (6 of them were metaanalysis and 7 were observational studies). Finally, 29 studies from 19 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria comprising of 16,724 patients (8115 patients in the SES group and 8609 patients in the PES group) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Table 3 reports the general features of all the 19 trials included in this meta-analysis. Features such as the number of participants involved in the SES group, number of participants involved in the PES group, the year of enrollment of patients for these trials, the follow-up periods as well as the Cochrane Bias Risk grade have been summarized in Table 3. Table 4 reports the baseline features of each of the included studies. Data from each study have been reported. The mean age of the patients, the percentage of male patients, the percentage of patients with hypertension, those patients who are current smokers and the percentage of patients who suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus have been listed in Table 4.
