A dual-luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to detect promoter activity in this study. A synthetic renilla luciferase reporter plasmid Phrl-SV40 (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a control for transfection efficiency. Panc-1 cells expressing different MUC1 constructs were cultured in DMEM plus 5% fetal bovine serum, and 10 000 cells/well were seeded into a 48-well plate and grown to B95% confluence. Each well was washed twice with PBS and transfected with 300 or 600 ng plasmid DNA using 2 ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) in 200 ml Optimem (Life Technologies), respectively. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, fed with 3 ml DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for another 2 days. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and harvested with 200 ml Passive Lysis buffer (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific). To detect firefly luciferase activity (from pA3 plasmids with cyclin D1 promoter), 20 ml of each lysate was reacted with 100 ml LARII buffer (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on ice. Relative light emission was detected using an Optocomp1 luminometer (MGM Instruments Inc, Hamden, CT, USA) reading 10 s with a 2-s delay. Subsequently, to detect the renilla luciferase activity (from SV-40 plasmids as transfection efficiency control), 100 ml Stop&Glo Reagent (Promega, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added into each well. The solution was vortexed for five seconds, and read again with the Optocomp1 luminometer. Light emission data (mean of triplicates) were presented as relative lumenescence units for each cell line and analyzed for statistical significance using Prism and InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Each experiment shown is representative of three independent replicates.
