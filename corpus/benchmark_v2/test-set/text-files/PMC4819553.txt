Analyses and visualization of data were performed in R (version 3.1.1) and RStudio (version 0.98.994). All samples had passed standard diagnostic quality control criteria [4, 6, 31].
Clinicopathological data and clinical outcome data of the 345 patient samples were analyzed using the statistical package SPSS 22.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, US). Survival analyses were performed to compare clinical performance of fresh and FFPE tissues. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare the survival distributions of MammaPrint for fresh and FFPE for distant metastasis as first event (DMF) and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). DMF was defined as the time from surgery until the diagnosis of a distant metastasis as first event. For DMF, patients who present with a local recurrence, regional recurrence, or second primary tumor before the diagnosis of a distant metastasis were censored at such event, at death or at the end of follow-up. DRFI was defined as the time from surgery until the diagnosis of a first distant metastasis or breast cancer-related death.
