The vast majority of the cases included were bilateral reconstructions (81.9%); thus, there was concern that these breasts were not independent. Therefore, when possible, the analyses were adjusted for clustering to correct for any potential dependence between breast pairs. All continuous data were reviewed for potential outliers, which were defined as values >3 SDs from the mean (11 breasts from 9 patients were excluded). Any cases with outliers were removed from analysis. The resulting patient characteristics, demographics, and complication frequencies between the 2 matrix types were compared using Fisher exact test (categorical variables), t tests, and Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables, normally or not-normally distributed, respectively). Additionally, a binomial logistic regression model using a general estimating equation (GEE) approach was used to determine significant predictors of whether a complication would occur or not. In addition to the matrix type, other a priori predictors were based on published data and included age, 25,26 body mass index (BMI), 27,28 duration of drain in place, 29 preoperative radiation treatment, 20,27 hypertensive status, 25 and active smoking status. 20,27 In all cases, significance was defined as P < 0.05. Furthermore, the results from the regression models are presented in terms of odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI), and the respective P value. All analyses were conducted using SPSS statistics 22 (IBM, Armonk, N.Y.).
