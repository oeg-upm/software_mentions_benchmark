All analyses were performed with Stata 2014 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Sampling weights for the years 2010-2014 were adjusted to account for pooling of the data. 29 We compared the two groups of immigrants (low and high acculturation) by sociodemographic characteristics and prevalence of hypertension, overweight/obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. We used chi-square test to assess differences in categorical variables and analysis of variance test for continuous variables. We estimated age-Central Asia 3869 (7) 1145 (30) 2724 (70) Southeast Asia 6073 (11) 1393 (23) 4680 (77) and sex-adjusted prevalence of overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia by length of residence in the US. We tested for effect modification of sex on the relationship between length of residence and CMR factors by including an interaction term (sex9length of residence). We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to determine the association between length of US residence and overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, adjusting for known confounders. For each of the four outcomes (overweight/obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia), we fitted 3 multiple logistic regression models with length of US residence as the main predictor (reference group <10 years) controlling for age, poverty status, health insurance, sex, and region of birth. In addition to these covariates, BMI was included as a covariate in the model with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia as the outcomes. These covariates were included because of their clinical importance, our bivariate findings, and previous studies, which have shown that these variables confound the relationship between acculturation and CMR factors. 25,30 A 2-tailed alpha with P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
