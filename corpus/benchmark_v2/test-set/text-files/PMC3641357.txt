Total RNA purified from two-independent cultures of DMSO passaged control and gefitinib-resistant cultures of HCC4006 cells and HCC827 cells was used to prepare cDNA for sequencing with the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx using the Illumina mRNA sequencing preparation kit (San Diego, CA, USA). Sequenced reads were mapped against hg19 using Tophat and transcripts were assembled against ensemble reference using Cufflinks. Expression is reported as fragments per kilobase transcript per million reads (FPKM). Data were submitted to applied bias correction and quartile normalization.
Anchorage-independent growth and cell proliferation assays For measurement of anchorage-independent cell growth, 50 000 cells (HCC4006, control or gefitinib resistant) were suspended in 1.5 ml RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.35% Difco agar noble (Becton Dickinson and Co., Sparks, MD, USA) and overlaid on base layers containing 1.5 ml RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% agar noble in six-well plates. The wells were covered with 2 ml growth medium containing drugs. This media was replaced with fresh media containing drugs every 7 days. The plates were incubated in a 37 1C CO 2 incubator for 21 days after which viable colonies were stained for 24 h with 200 ml of 1 mg/ml nitroblue tetrazolium. Following digital photography, the colony number was quantified using the MetaMorph imaging software program.
