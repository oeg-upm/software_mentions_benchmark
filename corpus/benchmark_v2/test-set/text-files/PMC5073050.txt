DCE-MRI to determine Gadomer-17 microvascular clearance. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was performed to determine the clearance of macromolecular tracers. The MR contrast agent Gadomer-17 has a molecular weight of 17 kDa, but due to its dendrimeric structure, its Stokes radius is as for globular proteins of molecular weight 35 kDa (Misselwitz et al. 2001). The contrast agent was injected over 15 s during scanning through a catheter in the tail vein after acquisition of 30 baseline images. For the ANP study, 0.4 mmol Gadomer kg À1 (diluted 1 : 4 in saline) was injected. In the rolipram study, 0.2 mmol Gadomer kg À1 was injected. The MRI was performed using a horizontal bore 7T small animal MRI instrument (PharmaScan; Bruker Corporation, Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with dedicated mouse bed and head coil. DCE-MRI data were obtained with a T1-weighted FLASH sequence (Fast Low Angle Shot) with a flip angle of 25°, repetition time and echo time of 13.77 and 2.52 ms respectively. A total of 600-1200 axial images through the masseter muscle were acquired with a sampling interval of 0.99 s, with a slice thickness of 1 mm, field of view of 2.5 cm and acquisition matrix of 96 9 96. A separate group of animals (n = 9) was used to determine the signal over time in large supplying vessels to the head to estimate the arterial input function (AIF). An oblique sagittal slice was positioned over the carotid arteries, and 1200 T 1 -weighted (same acquisition parameters as above) with a sampling interval of 0.99 s were acquired. The signal intensity over time was acquired in a region of interest of the internal masseter muscle using Nordic Image Control and Evaluation (nICE; Nordic Imaging Lab AS, Bergen, Norway). The data were further processed usingMATLAB (The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) to implement the step/slope model as previously described (Curry et al. 2010). The rate constant (0.0063 s À1 ) for Gadomer-17 was equal for all animals based on the estimation of the AIF above. The rate constants were estimated using blind deconvolution as previously described (Taxt et al. 2012).
Differences between groups were tested with one-way ANOVA with subsequent post hoc testing using GRAPHPAD INSTAT (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Twotailed t-tests were used when comparing only two groups. When testing ANP-effects, one-tailed testing was used as extensive studies by others and us have failed to demonstrate any case when ANP decreases endothelial permeability. The Mann-Whitney twotailed U-test (http://elegans.som.vcu.edu/~leon/stats/ utest.html) was used to assess whether endothelial slit calibre or the magnitude of endothelial junctional complex differed significantly between samples from Wt and Epac1 À/À mice, as such data are not normally distributed. Values are generally given as mean AE SEM.
