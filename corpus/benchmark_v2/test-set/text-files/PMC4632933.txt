This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, prospective phase II study. The primary objective of the study was to compare PFS associated with the use of IP and EP for the treatment of patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC. Secondary objectives were to compare the antitumor efficacy as assessed by ORR and OS, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of each regimen. All calculations and statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Comparisons of analyzed parameters between groups were performed with the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for proportional variables. Survival data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariable analysis of the associations between diarrhea and UGT1A1 genotype in the IP arm were assessed with logistic regression. Two sided values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
