Cardiomyocytes were lysed, and protein extraction was performed as previously described. [12] The soluble supernatant of the extracts was determined by the Bradford method, and 16 samples of 50 mg protein were prepared and separated on 10% acrylamide gels. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in tris-buffered saline Tween 20, containing 20 mmol/l tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mmol/l NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated with the antibodies against CRT (1:1000, Stressgen), Nrf2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), ATF4 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) (1:1000, Santa Cruz), CHOP (1:200, Santa Cruz), caspase-12 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), caspase-3 (1:1000, Santa Cruz), Bax (1:200, Santa Cruz), Bcl-2 (1:200, Santa Cruz) and GAPDH (1:500, Santa Cruz), respectively overnight at 4°C. After incubation for 2 hours with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the reaction was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The integrated optical density (mean intensity × area) of proteins was quantified using Image-Pro Plus. The relative level of analyzed protein expression was normalized to that of GAPDH.
Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate and cardiomyocytes were pooled from three to four different rat litters. Our data from three to four experiments was pooled and analyzed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA); data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Differences observed between the two groups were analyzed by two-sample t-tests for independent samples and among groups by one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls posttest analysis. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
