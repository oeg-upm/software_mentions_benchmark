Statistical analyses were carried out by SPSS statistics for Windows (Version 20.0. IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Continuous variables were expressed as meanAESD and analyzed by unpaired t tests, with Welch adjustment when necessary. Continuous variables that violated the normality assumption were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentiles and analyzed by a Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequency and were analyzed by the Pearson 2-test or the Fisher exact test whenever appropriate. Significant level was considered with P<0.05. Univariate analysis was carried out for patient data, and multivariate analysis by logistic regression was used to obtain data about the risk factors for AKI at the 3 time points: preoperative, ICU admittance, and 24 hours after ICU admittance. In the multivariate analysis, results were expressed by the odds ratio and the 95% confidence interval. The regression b of those variables obtained from logistic regression were used to develop the final 3 stage scores to predict CSA-AKI. The 1152 patients in the validation cohort were scored for validation, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) as well as Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were applied to estimate the reliability of the scoring for predicting CSA-AKI.
