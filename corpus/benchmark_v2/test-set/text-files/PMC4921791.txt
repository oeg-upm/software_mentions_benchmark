All data are reported as mean AE the standard error of the mean. Statistical outliers determined as 2.5 standard deviations outside of Original article the mean were excluded prior to statistical analysis. For plasma metabolites, there was a single outlier detected for hydroxybutyrate and two detected for glycerol. In liver, there was a single outlier detected for succinate, phenylalanine, Glx, citrulline, C6, C5-OH/C3-DC, C10, and C18:1 acylcarnitine; and two detected for leucine/ isoleucine. In skeletal muscle there was a single outlier detected for pyruvate, glycine, serine, proline, valine, leucine/isoleucine, C4/Ci4, C5, C6, and C14 acylcarnitine and two for lactate, succinate, C16, C18, and C18:1 acylcarnitine. For studies comparing all four experimental groups, a full factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed in JMP Pro 12 to evaluate diet and genotype effects followed by Tukey's HSD post-hoc test for all pairwise multiple comparisons. A Pearson's correlation test was performed in JMP Pro 12 to assess the association between urinary acetylglycine and skeletal muscle glycine levels. For clamp and metabolic cage studies where only ZFR fed the two diets were compared, an unpaired two-sided student's t-test was performed in  excel. In all cases, a P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
