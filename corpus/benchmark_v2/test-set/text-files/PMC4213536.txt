Since 2006, the Korean Movement Disorders Society (KMDS) has held annual nationwide campaigns and lectures regarding PD ("Red Tulip Campaign") to educate PD patients and caregivers in KMDS member hospitals. A survey of 1230 participants (PD patients and caregivers), organized by the KMDS, was performed at 44 sites from 48 secondary-or tertiary-referral hospitals in Korea from April 2, 2013 to June 14, 2013. No specific inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied, except that the patients were required to participate voluntarily and to be capable of answering the questionnaire. Trained interviewers collected demographic data from patients or caregivers and administered the 12-item questionnaire in face-to-face interviews with the participants at each site. Participants answered all questions with one of three answers (Yes, No, and Unknown). Demographic data included age, gender, PD duration, diagnosis of parkinsonianAcupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been proven safe 10 Acupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been proven efficacious 11 Acupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been proven globally, and it is currently used as a standard therapy for Parkinson's disease 12 Although acupuncture with bee venom for the treatment of Parkinson's disease is an experimental treatment without proof of safety and efficacy, I am willing to receive this experimental treatment if there is a chance JMD disorders, years of education, and the most disabling symptoms. Survey questionnaires developed by the executive committee of the KMDS was comprised of three parts Table 1). The first section of the questionnaire (4 questions) was designed to estimate the participant's knowledge of the pathogenesis and the medical and surgical treatments available for PD. The second section (3 questions) covered the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy, and whether stem cell therapy was used worldwide as an evidencebased practice. Questions in the final section were similar to those in the second section, except that the questions referred to bee venom acupuncture treatment rather than stem cell therapy. Two questions asked the participants whether they were willing to receive stem cell therapy or bee venom acupuncture treatment despite the fact that they were not safe, effective or acknowledged as a standard treatment around the world. For all questions, participants answered using the responses yes, no, or unknown. Other demographic data, such as age upon participation in the survey, gender, duration of PD, years of education, category of PD diagnosis and the most disabling symptom, were also collected in parallel. The categories of PD diagnosis comprised PD, Parkinson plus syndrome, and an unknown diagnostic parkinsonism category. The most disabling symptoms included tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability (falls), gait disturbance, and others. Statistical analyses were performed after converting participant responses into correct, incorrect, and unknown responses. The degree of accuracy of the understanding of PD between patients and caregivers was compared using chi-squared tests. Factors affecting an accurate understanding of PD treatment were analyzed using univariate logistic regression analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS program.
