SPSS statistical software 17.0 (IBM, USA) was used for data processing. The data were mostly expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Concentration differences between the TPE and MPE groups were evaluated for statistical significance using the nonparametric MannWhitney U-test. The optimal sensitivity and specificity points were selected as the critical values using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve; in this way, we calculated, for each of the TMs, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for diagnosing TPE and MPE. In addition, we evaluated the ability of a combination of all five TMs to distinguish between TPE and MPE. Three prognostic models were constructed: Model 1 involved the serum level of TMs, Model 2 the pleural fluid level, and Model 3 the P/S ratio. P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
