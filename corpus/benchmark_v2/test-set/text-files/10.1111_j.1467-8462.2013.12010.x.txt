One software solution to the many of the issues raised here is a tool called 'PanelWhiz' <http://www.panelwhiz.com>, which is written in and for the statistical package called Stata <http://www.stata.com>. For the German SOEP, its functionality is summarised in Haisken-DeNew and Hahn (2010). PanelWhiz was initially developed to deal specifically with the complexity of the German SOEP structure on variable naming, but has since expanded to cover all of the world's major household panel datasets.
PanelWhiz is a graphical user interface that allows users to extract data from known datasets in a controlled manner, without having to write data extraction code oneself. The structure of the data is in fact embedded into the data itself and is called up and read byPanelWhiz to allow it to use this structure automatically, without the user having to delve further in the data structure. In terms of the amount of Stata programming code, it is the largest-ever user-written collection of add-ons for Stata. PanelWhiz provides in Stata an analogous platform to what the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (for more information, see Minnesota Population Center 2001) does at the browser level. This article outlines the features of PanelWhiz in conjunction with Australian datasets that are listed in Table 1.
The obvious advantage of using PanelWhiz is the power of the common interface. Every survey supported by PanelWhiz, regardless of original structure, is integrated into the system in a similar manner. The entire dataset is scanned for critical pieces of information: (i) which physical data files belong together in a data year; (ii) variable names and how they correspond to each other over time; and (iii) keywords associated with variable labels.
In contrast to standard statistical software, one does not open a data file and select one single variable, but rather one can select an entire vector of variables belonging to each other. As all words used in variable labels are scanned, one can compile a total list of all used words from the labels and create an index of keywords or dictionary, linking each known keyword to a particular variable, which in turn can be related to an entire vector of variables which belong together over time.Â°C To start off, one selects the dataset of interest (in this case, HILDA Survey). Assuming that one were to start a data project from scratch, as in Figure 1, one would first be interested in opening either a specific wave or a keyword list. Here, we will examine a specific wave. The HILDA Survey contains information from 2001 to 2011, and correspondingly, there are clickable links for each year's wave. A browse page is created when clicking on a year. However, many datasets contain thousands of variables, making the creation of browse pages a relatively slow process. PanelWhiz creates a browse page once when needed, and if the page already exists, PanelWhiz simply uses it. The browse page is valid for a given distribution of data. It may become necessary to delete and recreate the browse pages if, for instance, there is a new release or revised version of the data.
After having selected several items and having stored the PanelWhiz project under a name, such as 'myproject', the Project Page would look something like in Figure 5.
The items selected would be sorted by their categories, such as 'AN' for 'Ancestry'. Adding any new items to the project would create additional entries in the Project Page. Here, in this particular view of the Project Page, we seeBy clicking on 'Retrieval', the data retrieval is started. File by file, the data files are opened, the selected variables are kept and possibly renamed, sub-sets of the files are stored in temporary files and then they are pieced together to create one rectangularised file inStata 'long' format (observations stacked on each other, year by year).
PanelWhiz is a tool written entirely in Stata's own programming language, which facilitates easy data extraction using a graphical user interface. Users are not required to write data retrieval programs, as PanelWhiz generates and runs extraction code on the fly, based on the variables selected. Due to its common interface and implementation for many datasets, it is useful for international comparative work and allows for an easy introduction to a new dataset for first-time users. As the data retrievals are standardised and used by many researchers, the chance of mistakes in the initial data-creation phase of any research is virtually reduced to zero. Updates to PanelWhiz are pushed to users and are installed in the same manner as Stata itself. PanelWhiz currently has more than 300 users and currently supports international datasets such as the German SOEP, the British BHPS (or its successor, the UK Understanding Society study), the American PSID and Current Population Survey-National Bureau of Economic Research, the American Survey of Income and Program Participation, the South African National Income Dynamics Study, in addition to the HILDA Survey, MABEL, LSAC, LSIC and CASiE. PanelWhiz runs in Windows, Mac and Linux, but needs at least Stata SE/MP 11 or later to run.
