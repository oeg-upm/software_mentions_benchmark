Fragment-based tools such as SuperLooper depend on databases too large to distribute as stand-alone programs (âˆ¼80 GB in the case of SL2). The rapid delivery of a large number of possible loop conformation makes web-based tools a perfect candidate. The database remains on a server and the user is able to choose a suitable loop from listed results using a web-based molecule viewer. Here, we use NGL (20) for protein and fragment visualization, which adopts capabilities of modern web browsers, such as WebGL for molecular graphics. NGL allows interactive display of even large molecular complexes and is unaffected by the retirement of third-party plug-ins such as Flash or Java-Applets. This viewer offers comprehensive molecular visualization through a graphical user interface so that life scientists can easily access and utilize available structural data without any further installations (20).
Thus, SL2 benefits from the significantly enlarged database of fragments and new fast molecule viewer. Due to the improved coverage of the conformational loop space, the quality of prediction, measured by the backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD), has improved by 20% on average compared to our previous version (17). The new version of our fragment-based web-application for loop modeling SL2 thus has an improved performance in loop prediction as well as an up-to-date visualization.
Geometrical fingerprint matching is used as a criterion to estimate the sterical fit of stem atoms of N-and C-termini of each database fragment to the C-and N-terminal stem atoms of a gap in a protein structure. The geometrical fingerprints of both the stem atoms of each database fragment and the stem atoms of the gap are composed of the distance between the N-and C-terminal stem atoms and three angles defining their relative orientation Figure 1). Compared to our previous version, we slightly altered the geometric fingerprint. Previously, we used a combination of two distances and two angles for scoring, resulting in a higher weighting of the fit of the residue where the angle was measured. In SL2, we solved this problem employing distance and three angles.
Since the first release of SuperLooper in 2008, the number of entries deposited in the RSCB PDB has more than doubled from 54 543 structures to 114 693 in 2015. A total of 901 609 231 fragments with a length of 3 to 35 residues was extracted from this enlarged pool of template structures (Figure 2A). Because more short than long overlapping fragments are extracted from a given template structure,mented that automatically adds novel fragments to the LIP or LIMP database every three months.
Due to (partial) embedding into the lipid bilayer, loops of membrane proteins have a more hydrophobic amino acid composition compared to loops of globular proteins (21). Tools developed for the prediction of loops connecting transmembrane helices were indeed found to enhance prediction of GPCR loops (22). In SL2, such loops can be selected from LIMP, which is a collection of fragments extracted from loops of all helical transmembrane proteins. Loops were defined as parts without regular fold, thus also containing kinks, bulges or re-entrant loops (23). To allow selection of membrane protein loops taking the lipid bilayer into account, the extension of the lipid bilayer is indicated by two parallel planes (as described below).
For visual inspection of results, we employed the NGL viewer which works without installation of additional plugins (20). As a common graphical user interface for theNGL viewer Figure 3) the search mask and the results list were implemented within JavaScript. A protein structure uploaded via the file selection dialog is instantly loaded to the NGL viewer. The stem residues of the gap in the protein model must either be typed into the according search field or can be selected by clicking them in the NGL viewer. The sequence of the missing segment must be typed or copied into the search mask. If the membrane protein-specific LIMP data base (Membrane DB) is not checked, the LIP data base will be searched. After the submission button is pressed, the search is started. Depending on the loop length, results are expected to appear after few seconds or up to half a minute in the results list.
Visualization is carried out by the NGL viewer (20). To use the full feature set of the NGL viewer an up-to-date web browser (tested on the recent versions of Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, IE and Edge) is recommended. The specialized graphical user interface is written in JavaScript. For job handling a simple python job server based on the Flask framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/) is used.
The updated version of our fragment based web-application tool for loop modeling, SL2, benefits from an enlarged fragment database and a new user interface including an updated protein viewer. As a result of the enlarged fragment database the prediction quality has been further improved. Using the same dataset (15) and validation procedure as in our previous publication (17), an average gain in prediction quality by 20% is observed for loops of 3-16 residues length Figure 4). A drop of the backbone RMSD between experimentally determined and modeled loops (only the top hit was considered) starts to become evident for loops with eight residues length. This implies that the coverage of possible loop conformations has been further optimized starting with this length.
Despite the gain of prediction quality, the top hit results obtained by SL2 sometimes deviate from the experimentally determined structure even for short loops. There are several Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, Web Server issue W393possible reasons for this. First, many loops are highly flexible or are even located in structurally disordered regions of proteins (26,27). The conformations suggested by SL2 may thus indicate alternative loop conformations not observed by protein X-ray structure crystallography (e.g. Figure S6 in (28)). Second, as scoring of the loops mainly depends on the stem residues, experimentally caused distortions of these stem atoms may prevent selection of a specific conformation (29). Prediction quality drops with loop length, mainly due to the increased conformational space. A promising strategy to enhance prediction quality of longer loops would be inclusion of additional experimental constraints such as mass spectrometry (30,31) or electron density maps from single particle cryo-electron microscopy (32).
