We used w 2 test or Fisher's exact test to determine the correlation between mesothelin and clinicopathological data. Survival curves of patients were drawn by the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in survival curves were analysed by the log-rank test. Prognostic implications of mesothelin expression and clinicopathological parameters were analysed by Cox univariate and multivariate proportional hazards models. All differences were considered significant at a P-value of o0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using Statview 5.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
