As noted in Online Appendix A, the variable Asset has a very high proportion of zero's. This would imply that the individual's relative risk aversion is infinite, a rather extreme assumption. We tested the sensitivity to this extreme value by adding a dummy to distinguish zero and positive values; thus, the regression equation included 17 In Footnote 14 Shaw also notes that she dropped interaction of the intercept with the risk attitude dummies. We decided not to follow her and stick to the full model. 18 Since comparing estimates involves combined coefficients (e.g. β ·a xi ), we need to take into account the standard deviation of such combination. This is done by using the "nonlinear combinations of estimators" option in STATA. 19 For Italy the null hypothesis is not rejected for the interaction between ARA and years of schooling.a dummy for having any risky financial assets at all and the share of risky financial assets. In the SHIW data for Italy, with the highest proportion of zero's, including the dummy has no effect on the results for the other variables; the significance level for the share of risky assets does not change in any relevant way. 20
