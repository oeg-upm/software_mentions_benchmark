The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to determine statistical significance between the study groups. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC) was calculated for the diagnostic accuracy. Pearson correlation was used to determine correlations between RSCV, axial length, NFLT, and visual field test MD. A coefficient of variance (CV) was applied to evaluate reproducibility. Two reproducibility tests were performed. The first one compares RSCV value at R ¼ 2.8 mm and R ¼ 3.0 mm. The second test compares results graded independently by two of the authors (OT and LL). All image processes and statistical analyses were done usingMatlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA).
