cDNA Library Construction and DNA Sequencing RNA isolation kit (Pharmacia) was used to extract the total RNA from cells grown under +Fe and ÀFe conditions, and contaminating genomic DNA was digested with DNase I. PolyA+ RNA was isolated using a PolyA+ tract mRNA isolation kit (Promega). Complementary DNA was synthesized using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit after priming with oligo-dT. The cDNA was then directionally cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene). Single and well-separated plaques were cored out from agar plates and transferred to 96-well microtiter plates containing SM buffer. The phage stocks were used as templates for cDNA insert amplification with T3 and T7 primers (1 nM for each primer). The amplified products were separated in 1.5% agarose gels, and clones that yielded single polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified bands were collected for sequencing. Single-pass sequencing from the 5 0 -end of the cDNA insert was initiated with a T3 primer using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing products were resolved and analysed on an ABI PRISM 377 (Applied Biosystems) or a MEGABACE DNA Sequencer (GE). The nucleotide sequences obtained were processed with the Phred/Phrap/ Consed package (http://www.phrap.org/phredphrapconsed .html).
Putative coding regions from the EST data were collected from BLASTX alignments, and the codon usage bias was calculated. A Perl script was also written to locate poly-A tails and to search 10-35 bp upstream for putative mRNA poly-adenylation signals; the script allowed one mismatch and two mismatches from the sequence AAUAAA. Putative signal sequences and transmembrane domains in the coding regions were identified by SignalP 3.0 and TMHMM 2.0 (http://www .cbs.dtu.dk/services/), respectively. Putative Trichomonas protein kinases and peptidases were identified by sequence comparison with datasets downloaded from the KinBase (http:// www.kinase.com) and the MEROPS (http://merops.sanger.ac .uk) databases, respectively.
Oligonucleotide primers (supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online) were designed using Primer Designer software v1.01 (Scientific and Education software). The primers were tested prior to qRT-PCR analysis using DNA as a template, and single amplicons of the proper size were sequenced. The RT reaction contained 1 mg of total RNA, 500 ng of Oligo(dT) 15 Primer (Invitrogen), 5 mM DTT (Invitrogen), 2 U of RNasin (Invitrogen), 10 U of SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 500 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. The reactions were incubated at 42 C for 50 min followed by 15 min at 70 C. For qRT-PCR, 1 ml of cDNA was amplified in a 25 ml reaction mixture containing each gene-specific primer at 50 nM and 12.5 ml of iQTM SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad). All reactions were performed in triplicate using a RotorGene 2000 Real-Time PCR cycler (Corbett Life Science). The expression levels of each gene were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene b-tubulin, expression of which is not affected by the availability of iron. Relative quantitative values were obtained by the comparative threshold cycle (2 ÀÁÁC T ) method as described by (Livak and Schmittgen 2001).
