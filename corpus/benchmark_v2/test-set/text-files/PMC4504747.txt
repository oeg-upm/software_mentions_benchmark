Allelic association was adjusted for age, duration of diabetes, gender and multiple testing using PLINK software (version1.07 [12]) for de novo genotyping. PLINK (http:// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink) is a free, opensource whole-genome association analysis toolset, which efficiently performs association studies for single SNPs or computationally intensive genome-wide association studies. Replication was conducted in silico for the FinnDiane (n = 2910) and USA (n = 1595) populations, followed by de novo genotyping in a Danish (n = 588) cohort. Genotype data were evaluated for their association with diabetic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
