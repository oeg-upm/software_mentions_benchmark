The radio-transmission pH-measurement system consists of a wireless pH sensor, a data measurement receiver, a relay unit and a personal computer with special software (YCOW-S; DKK-Toa Yamagata) (Sato et al. 2012b) installed. The wireless system utilized a specified low-power radio transmission system (429 MHz band), which could be operated without a license in accordance with Japanese Radio Law. The mean variations of the measurements by the glass pH electrode were + 0.20 after 2 months of continuous recording, compared to the values confirmed by a standard pH solution at the start of the recording. The mean lifetime of the internal battery was 3 months when measurements were continuously transmitted every 10 min. There was a good correlation between continuous recording and spot sampling (r = 0.986, P < 0.01), when the ruminal pH recorded by our new system was compared to that of the spot sampling of ruminal fluid (Sato et al. 2012b). We have demonstrated the possible application of the radio-transmission pH-measurement system for assessment and monitoring of the ruminal pH in cows. Our new system might contribute to accurate assessment and prevention of SARA. In this chapter, our experimental results of basic tests for performance of radiotransmission pH-measurement system are described.
