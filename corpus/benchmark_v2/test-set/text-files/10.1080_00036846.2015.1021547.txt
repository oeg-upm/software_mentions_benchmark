In the next step, we explain the choice of our preferred model. As expected, OLS estimates of parameter ρ are somehow larger than those of FE. However, reported point estimates of parameters using bias-corrected FE (we employed Bruno, 2005 Stata routine) are almost the same as the FE estimates, which suggest that the Nickell bias seems negligible in our context (and that OLS estimates suffer from omitted variable bias). Also the significance of country dummies suggests that OLS estimates may not be the most reliable ones. Finally, it should be noted that the FE estimates have a relatively small variance, especially if compared to consistent estimators as GMM (Mátyás and Sevestre, 2008) or bias-corrected FE. For these reasons, we choose the simple FE estimator as the preferred one. Regarding the specification tests, the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation shows that including the lagged dependent variable and year dummies reduces problems with autocorrelation. At no reasonable significance level, the null hypothesis (i.e. that there is no autocorrelation) should be rejected. To deal with heterogeneity we use robust SEs.
