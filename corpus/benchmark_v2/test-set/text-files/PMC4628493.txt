The computer model of the mandible was constructed using Rhinoceros 4.0 software (McNeel North America, Seattle, WA) and was based on a previous three-dimensional model of a mandible taken from a data bank. The data bank model was created using images from the Multislice Helical Computed Tomography of human jaws (volunteers), with a cutting thickness of 1 mm [6]. The mandible was cut in the right side angle area to simulate a fracture with bone loss. In this model, the teeth were removed to simplify the modelling, and a geometric reference was created in the location of the right first molar on the alveolar ridge. This reference was used to mark the region for future displacement application. The computer model of the titanium plates and screws was developed based on a sketch of products from Tóride ® (Tóride Indústria e Comércio Ltd, Mogi-Mirim, São Paulo -Brazil). The three-dimensional geometry of the plates and screws was created using Rhinoceros 4.0 software. One 2 mm locking plate was developed based on information acquired from the literature regarding stress distribution and the use of a single tension band plate in mandibular angle fractures [7,8].
