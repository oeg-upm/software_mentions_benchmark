Statistical analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between regular low-UTI and frequency of UTI-ab and bladder cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for the following, potentially confounding, factors: age at UBC diagnosis/at time of completing questionnaire (in years), smoking status (categorical variable: never smokers, former smokers, current smokers (i.e., those who had not stopped in the year prior to the year of UBC diagnosis (for patients) or filling out the questionnaire (for controls)), cumulative smoking exposure in terms of pack-years of cigarettes, use of aspirin and ibuprofen/ brufen (yes/no), and education (categorical variable). Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether the associations differed for non-muscle invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer, age at onset of UTI (below or above sex-specific median age), menopausal state at onset UTI (using a threshold of 51 years as proxy), and smoking status (never vs ever). All analyses were stratified for gender. A (two-sided) P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, release 20.0.0.1 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
