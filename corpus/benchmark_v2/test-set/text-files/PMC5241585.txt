In vivo anti-Plasmodium activity was examined using groups of six female BALB/c mice (6e8 weeks old; Animal Resources Centre, Perth, Australia) infected via intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection with 10 5 P. berghei QIMR (Saul et al., 1997) (Sumanadasa et al., 2012)). Chloroquine (10 mg/kg in PBS) was a positive control administered via oral gavage twice daily for three days beginning 2 h p.i. Peripheral parasitemia was monitored daily from day 4 p.i. by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears prepared from tail snip bleeds. Mice were euthanized according to an approved scorecard of criteria and all animal work was conducted using protocols approved by National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia Animal Code of Practice, as approved by the Griffith University Animal Ethics committee. Data were analysed using two-tailed Student's t-Test using Graph Pad Prism (version 5).
