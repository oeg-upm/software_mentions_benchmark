For the determination of peripheral chronic stress markers, whole blood was collected into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes from nonstressed and chronically stressed Fisher-344 (F344), Brown Norway (BN-SS), Lewis (Lew) and WKY male rats of B100 days of age and of different litters (n Â¼ 3 per strain per experimental condition). The chronically stressed animals were restrained in a breathable decapicone for 2 h per day for a 2-week period. Total RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, and then reverse transcribed followed by secondstrand cDNA synthesis. For each sample, an in vitro transcription reaction was carried out incorporating biotinylated nucleotides according to the manufacturer's protocol for Illumina Totalprep RNA amplification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Then, 1.5 mg biotin-labeled cRNA was hybridized onto RatRef-12 Expression BeadChips (Illumina, San Diego CA, USA) for 16 h at 55 1C. Post-hybridization staining and washing were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Illumina). Illumina Sentrix RatRef-12 v1.0 BeadChips were scanned using Illumina's BeadStation 500 scanner. Images were checked for grid alignment and then quantified using the BeadStudio software.
The two sets of blood gene expression data came from different microarray platforms. For this reason, we carried out a detailed comparison between the Affymetrix and Illumina platforms used, and validated a number of selected transcripts' abundances by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) as described previously. 24 Statistical analyses of microarray data. Analyses to establish significant differences in gene expression between WMI and WLI for the different tissues were carried out as described previously. 24 Briefly, probe intensity data from Rat 230v2 Affymetrix GeneChip arrays were read into the R software environment (http://www.R-project.org) directly from .CEL files using the R/affy package. 33 The normalization of the Affymetrix data was performed by tissue type using the robust multiarray average method for probe set data. 34 Probe intensity data from Illumina Chip arrays were read into the R software environment directly from Bead summary files produced by BeadStudio using the R/beadarray package. 35 Quantile normalization was applied to the Illumina bead summary data using the R/preprocessCore package. 36 Data
Blood biomarkers for early-onset MDD K Pajer et al quality was assessed using histograms of signal intensities, scatterplots, and hierarchical clustering of samples. Analysis of variance methods were used to statistically resolve gene expression differences from both studies after data processing and normalization using the R/maanova package. 37,38 Study 2: human subjects: recruitment and procedures.
Pubertal stage was assessed with the Tanner Self-Rating Schematic Drawings. 39 Demographic characteristics and the youth's lifetime medical history were evaluated through a brief interview with the parent and the Risks and Disorders subdomains of the Child Health and Illness Profile-Adolescent Edition (CHIP-AE). 40 The lifetime history of psychiatric diagnoses was assessed with the computerized version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and Adolescents-IV (CDISC-IV; NIMH, 1998), Parent and Youth Versions. The CDISC is a structured psychiatric interview, organized into six Axis I diagnostic sections: Anxiety Disorders, Mood Disorders, Disruptive Behavior Disorders, Schizophrenia, Miscellaneous Disorders (for example, Eating Disorders) and Substance-Use Disorders. 41 Psychometric testing of the CDISC has demonstrated good validity and reliability. 42,43 Every participant and parent received the entire diagnostic assessment.
Determination of blood transcript levels of candidate markers. Blood was drawn on all participants, but the only samples sent to the Redei lab were those of youths suffering from current MDD or those without any disorder (ND). The Redei lab was blind to any information about the participants. Whole-blood RNA was isolated using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction; cDNA was prepared using random primers and the TaqMan RT reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Specific primers, listed in Supplementary Table S1, were designed to amplify the human ortholog of the rat microarray probe region of the candidate markers using the ABI's Primer Express Software (version 3.0, PE Applied Biosystems). qPCR was carried out using SYBR Green and the ABI 7900 (Applied Biosystems), with 18s rRNA as the internal control. 18s was chosen as the normalizing gene after an extensive comparative pilot study using several housekeeping genes (data not shown). Each sample for each transcript was measured in triplicate using 5 ng of template.
Statistical analyses of human data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and nonparametric statistics to analyze gene expression differences between the ND and MDD groups or between the MDD subgroups with and without comorbid anxiety disorders. Spearman's rho correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the relationships between the CTQ scores and gene expression levels. Because this is a pilot study, effect sizes are more informative than statistical significance. We calculated effect sizes for all differences between means, using Hedges' because of small sample and unequal subgroup sizes. Correlation coefficients themselves can serve as estimates of effect sizes, and hence we report rho values for these analyses. We made an a priori decision to interpret an effect size of X0.50 as clinically significant, which corresponds to Cohen's medium effect size. 45 We did not control for multiple comparisons, as the goal of a pilot study is to detect as many potentially clinically significant relationships as possible. Data analyses were performed with SPSS 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
