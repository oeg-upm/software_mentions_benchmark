Apoptosis was detected by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) using the fluorescein-dUTP-in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). For TUNEL assay, cells were seeded on microscope cover glasses pre-coated with 0.1% poly-D-lysine [prepared in 100 mM Na 2 B 4 O 7 .10(H 2 O) buffer at pH 8.2], and cultured over-night in the HG-medium. After confirming attachment of cells to the cover slips, medium was changed to LG-medium for over-night starvation. Glucose was added to the starved cells at different concentrations and for different time periods, after which TUNEL was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, and then washed in PBS. Cells were permeabilized in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate on ice, washed twice with PBS and incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 • C in a humidified atmosphere in the dark. Slides were washed twice with PBS, stained with DAPI for nuclei detection, and washed again with PBS. The cover glasses with cells were flapped on glass slides covered with a few drops of mounting media (DakoCytomation), photographed using an upright fluorescence microscope (Axioscop 2, ZEISS), and processed by the Image Pro software.
Apoptosis was also detected by PARP cleavage from 116 kDa into 89 kDa fragments using western blot analysis. Since PARP is a nuclear protein, we decided to test its cleavage in nuclear extracts and not in whole-cell extracts to prevent dilution. Nuclear extracts were prepared and collected as described previously (Schreiber et al., 1989). Proteins were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for 1 h, and subsequently probed with a primary monoclonal antibody: anti-PARP (SeroTec, UK) that detects the full length as well as the cleaved PARP. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent-ECL (prepared locally) and visualized by autoradiography. AChE expression was also detected using western blot analysis. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared (Schreiber et al., 1989), and separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described above. A rabbit anti-human polyclonal AChE antibody, which detects all isoforms of AChE, was used (sc-11409, diluted 1:500 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA). A mouse monoclonal antibody anti-α-Tubulin (T6199, diluted 1:4000 from Sigma-aldrich, USA) was used for normalizing cytoplasmic protein loading. HRP-conjugated Donkey-anti-rabbit or anti mouse (1:5000 diluted in 50% glycerol, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., USA) was used as secondary antibody. Densitometry analysis was done by TotalLab Quant software.
