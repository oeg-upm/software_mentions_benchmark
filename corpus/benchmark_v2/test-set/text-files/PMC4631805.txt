Statistical analysis and mathematical modeling. The area under the OXPHOS protein complex 4-time curve (AUC OXPHOS4 ) from days 6 to 16 was calculated for each hollow-fiber arm from the toxicity studies using Prism software version 6.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). The complex 4 AUC OXPHOS from days 6 to 16 was graphed against the linezolid free-drug 24-h AUC exposure and free-drug trough concentrations achieved for each regimen in the HFIM system. An inhibitory sigmoid-E max effect model was fitted to the data using ADAPT V software. Parameter estimates were obtained employing maximum-likelihood estimation.
The impact of linezolid on both the total M. tuberculosis burden and the less-susceptible subpopulation burden was analyzed in a population sense employing the program BigNPAG, a nonparametric (for parameter distributions) adaptive grid program written by Leary et al. and Neely et al (22, 23). Starting weights were as estimates of the inverse of the observation variance for each of the three system outputs. The adaptive ‚ê• function in BigNPAG was employed to optimize the weights so as to give the best approximation to the homoscedastic assumption. The three system outputs were (i) measurement of linezolid concentration-time profiles in each HFIM arm, (ii) measurement of total M. tuberculosis burden in each HFIM arm, and (iii) measurement of the less linezolid-susceptible subpopulation in each HFIM arm.
