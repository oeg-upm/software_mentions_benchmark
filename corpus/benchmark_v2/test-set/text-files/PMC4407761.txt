Interferon γ (IFN-γ) Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot (ELISpot) Assay IFN-γ-precoated 96-well plates were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mabtech, Sweden). PBMCs (400 000 cells/well) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium plus 10% fetal calf serum were added to wells, along with negative control (medium alone) or influenza virus antigens (5 µg/mL of split virus vaccine of each strain; H1N1, H3N2, B). Plates were incubated overnight (37°C, 5% CO 2 ) and developed the following day. The plates were read using the Immunoscan reader and associated software (CTL-Europe). The negative control was subtracted from the influenza virus-specific response.After overnight stimulation, cells were stained and analyzed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer for the expression of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α, as described earlier [24]. The antibodies used are provided in Supplementary Table 1, and the gating strategy is specified in Supplementary Figure 2.
Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS, version 17, andGraphPad Prism, version 5 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California). For all statistical tests, a P value of < .05 was considered significant. ICS results were compared using t test.
