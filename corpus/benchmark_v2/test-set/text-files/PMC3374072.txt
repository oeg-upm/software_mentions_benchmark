Lactobacillus strain collection and MALDI-TOF spectra database. The Lactobacillus strain collection of our laboratory has been completed by the strains from the Pasteur and DSMZ collections, and reference spectra have been created from those missing in the Bruker database. Bacterial identification was undertaken with an Autoflex II mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH). Data were automatically acquired using Flex control 3.0 and Maldi Biotyper Automation Control 2.0. (Bruker Daltonics GmbH). Raw spectra, obtained for each isolate, were analyzed by standard pattern matching (with default parameter settings) against the spectra of species used as a reference database. An isolate was regarded as correctly identified at the species level when at least one spectrum had a score X1.9, and one spectrum had a score X1.7. 28 The reproducibility of the method was evaluated by the duplicate analysis of 10 samples.
First, the results of Lactobacillus-specific culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were compared in the two groups (obese and control group) using the Fisher's exact test when comparing proportions, and the Mann-Whitney test when comparing bacterial concentrations. A difference was considered statistically significant when Po0.05. In order to identify which qPCR bacterial groups (Bacteroidetes, B. animalis, Lactococcus lactis, L. acidophilus, L. casei/paracasei, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. plantarum, L. reuteri, L. rhamnosus) was most associated with the likelihood of being obese while taking into account possible confounders like age or gender, a logistic regression model was used. Variables with a liberal Po0.20 in the univariate logistic regression analysis were considered eligible for the multiple logistic regression analyses. 30 A secondary analysis based on logistic regression analysis was used to identify which culture variables (Lactobacillus species concentration) where associated with obesity. Data analyses were conducted using SPSS v.9.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
