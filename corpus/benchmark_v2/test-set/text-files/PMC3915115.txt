In order to retain sufficient number of cases to support the subgroup analysis, which includes surgeons' perceptions in a nested model, all variables with non-significant coefficients were removed from the final main model. In addition one health measure was selected and retained as representative of the remaining health measures. Both the main and nested models were tested for goodness of fit (Hosmer & Lemeshow) and discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic curve). Data were analysed using STATA version 12.
All of the self reported measures of health demonstrate significantly worsening health with increasing age (Table 5). Participants aged X85years were more likely to have difficultly or need help with ADL (Po0.001) with over 50% of this age group, also having a ECOG performance status of 2 or more, compared with 21-37% of younger women (Po0.001). The proportion experiencing mild to moderate cognitive problems according to the 6CIT screening tool was over twice as large among women aged X85 years (30.1%) compared with younger age groups (p14%) (Po0.001). Body mass index reduced with age (Po0.001) and a greater proportion of those aged over 80 years were non-smokers compared with younger women (P ¼ 0.008). There was over a 10% increase in the proportion scoring 1 or more on the Charlson co-morbidity index: from 41.1% of 70-74-year-olds to 52.9% of X85-year-olds (P ¼ 0.016). All measures of health were significantly associated with receipt of surgery (Table 5), with poorer health decreasing the likelihood of undergoing surgery. Over two thirds of those not undergoing surgery had a co-morbidity score of 1 or more compared with 44.0% of surgical patients. Those not receiving surgery were also more likely to need help with ADL (Po0.001) with 63.4% of these non-surgical patients having a ECOG performance status score of 2 or more compared with 26.4% of women having surgery (Po0.001). Non-surgical patients also had a slightly lower body mass index (P ¼ 0.006) and were more likely to smoke (P ¼ 0.007).
