Renal morphology was evaluated using Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS)-stained 5-m paraffin sections, based on at least 50 glomeruli per kidney section. The percentage of glomeruli containing microaneurysms was counted in sections from rats terminated at day 7. The Glomerular Sclerosis Index (GSI) was calculated as previously described [14] in sections from rats terminated at day 28. For the GSI, glomeruli were scored based on the percentage of the glomerular area that was sclerotic (normal = 0, ! 25% = 1, 25-50% = 2, 50-75% = 3, 75-100% = 4). Renal artery wall thickness of the cortical intrarenal arteries in PAS-stained kidney sections was measured using AnalySIS 3.0 software (Soft Imaging Systems, MÃ¼nster, Germany), based on lamina externa and interna diameters and using the average of at least five vessels per kidney section.
All values are expressed as mean 8 SEM. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.0 software. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Student t test, and one-or two-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis post-hoc test if appropriate. A p value ! 0.05 was considered significant.
