Group differences for categorical variables were assessed by chi-square test, and continuous variables were examined by Student's t-test. The association between genotype and adiponectin level was evaluated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses. The results are presented as mean±st-andard error range. p-values for each genotype and allele were evaluated by χ 2 analysis and Fisher's exact test. A p-value with three decimal places was taken to indicate statistically significant differences between statin-free and statin-treated subjects of the study. Associations between clinical variables, such as age, BMI, and TC, were analyzed by Pearson correlation test. All analyses were performed using SPSS software, version18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
