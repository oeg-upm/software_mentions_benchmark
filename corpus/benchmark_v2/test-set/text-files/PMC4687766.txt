Transcripts and notes of interviews were analysed with the aid of ATLAS.ti (version 4.2; Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin), a computer software package for qualitative data. The semi-structured interview schedule was employed flexibly and was also grounded in that it was adapted as the study progressed. A preliminary analysis on the first 12 patient interviews was undertaken by the first author (G.D.-W.), who also conducted the interviews. Subsequently, the conceptual framework was expanded in discussion with all the authors of this article. Although the original aim was to describe patient experiences relating to investigation and management of their ataxia, it rapidly became evident as the baseline interviews progressed that most people's contact with health services ended when diagnostic investigations were completed, whether or not an underlying aetiology was found. Accordingly, diagnosis became a focus in the interviews and in the analysis. This article focuses especially on the follow-up data as these experiences are likely to better reflect the current situation for users in services, as opposed to their own historical experiences of health services, which in some cases stretched back several decades. In the results to follow, interview extracts are labelled using two or three fields showing the participant ID, quotation number and (in baseline interviews only) line numbers from the interview transcript (e.g. P14: 6: 74-78 or P37: 12).
