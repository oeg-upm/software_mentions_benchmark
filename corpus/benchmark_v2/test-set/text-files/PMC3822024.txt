The statistical analysis was performed with SAS (version 9.2,SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The data was expressed as the mean Â± SD, median (range), or number of patients. The sample size was based on a previous study [3] which had a three-dermatome difference in maximal block height with an alpha error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. Twenty-two patients per group were necessary to demonstrate statistical significance. To compare variables between the two groups, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to identify the variables with a normal distribution. Variables with a normal distribution were compared by independent t-tests. Spinal anesthesia in second trimester and those without a normal distribution were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test. The number of patients was compared between the groups using the chi-square test. Value comparisons for each measurement were also conducted using repeated measures of ANOVA. All significant results were also analyzed with Tukey's post hoc test to determine whether time points produced values significantly different from baseline values. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
