The HDL particle diameter was determined according to the method described by Perusse et al (20), by gradient gel electrophoresis using 4 to 25% polyacrylamide. After the gels had been equilibrated at 120 V for 60 min, electrophoresis was performed for each gel containing the serum sample diluted 1:2 with sample buffer (consisting of 40% sucrose, 0.06% EDTA-2Na, and 0.01% BPP), to a volume of 20 ÂµL. Each gel also contained thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, and lactate dehydrogenase as reference standards of known diameter. The gels were then electrophoresed at 15 V for 15 min, followed by migration at 70 V for 20 min, at 75 V for 16 h, and finally at 125 V for 8 h. The gels were then stained for lipid overnight with Sudan Black, and for reference standards with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for 45 min. They were then decolorified with ethanol and kept immersed in acetic acid. The decolorified gels were then scanned with an image scanner (Epson GT-6500: Seiko Epson Corporation, Nagano, Japan) and analyzed using an image processing and analysis program for Macintosh (NIH Image 1.61: National Institutes of Health, United States). Migration distances were determined. The HDL particle diameter was then calculated by comparing the mobility of the sample with that of the three calibrated standards on each gel. A higher integrated HDL size indicated a greater proportion of "large" HDL particles, whereas a low HDL size suggested an increased prevalence of "small" HDL particles. Inter-and intra-assay coefficients of variation for the integrated HDL size assessed by this method were < 3% (n=10) and <2% (n=9), respectively.
