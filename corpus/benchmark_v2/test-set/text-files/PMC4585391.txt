Comparisons of preprandial GHR and OB as well as GHR/OB ratio between patients and controls were performed with Student's t-test, whereas paired t-test was used for comparisons between pre-and postprandial levels. Finally, t-test was also used to compare both pre-and postprandial levels between patients with normal and delayed GET. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test. Furthermore the adjusted eff ect of diff erent factors [gender, age, body mass index (BMI z-score)] on GET, levels of GHR and OB, GHR/OB (pre-and postprandial) was explored using multiple regression analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 17.0 soft ware (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). P values <0.05 were considered statistically signifi cant.
