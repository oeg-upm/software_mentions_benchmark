Pre-operative planning for tumour resection. Pre-operative bone CT and MRI scans are obtained respectively for CT with 0.5 mm spacing between slices and 1 mm slice thickness, and for MRI according to the resolution needed for diagnosis. The open-source software ITK- Snap 2.0.0 35 is used to manually delineate the tumour on each MRI slice where it is visible.
