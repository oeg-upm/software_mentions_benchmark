Galileos Comfort (Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) X-ray unit was used to capture the CBCT images of the individuals with exposure parameters of 85 kVp, 21 mA, 14 seconds, 0.3 mm voxel size and with volume dimensions of 15 cm×15 cm×15 cm. The image reconstruction time was approximately 4.5 minutes. The images were viewed and assessed with OsiriX (Pixmeo, Geneva, Switzerland). Two-dimensional coronal slices Fig. 1) were created in order to measure the amount of dental expansion, angulation of the teeth, and buccal bone width using the reslicing function of the software. All CBCT measurements were made on standardized slices created at the level of trifurcation of the maxillary first molars and bifurcation of the maxillary first premolars perpendicular to the midsagittal plane. Palatal expansion at the maxillary first molars and first premolars was measured at the most palatal aspect of the teeth. Buccal bone measurements of the maxillary first molars and first premolars were made at the level of their trifurcation and bifurcation points, respectively. Linear measurements were recorded in millimeters, and angular measurements were recorded in degrees Table 1).
