Amplicon purification and sequencing, sequence editing and dataset assembling followed the protocols of Santos et al. (2010). Phylogenetic trees were inferred in MrBayes v. 3.0b4 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) by Bayesian analysis and in PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony)  v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002) by Maximum Parsimony (MP) using the heuristic search option with random addition of sequences (1 000 replications), tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) and MULTREES options ON. Bayesian analysis was performed as described in Phillips et al. (2007), setting burn-in at 2 000 generations. Bootstrap support values with 1 000 replications (Felsenstein 1985) were calculated for branches in the MP trees using MULTREES option OFF and 10 random sequence additions in each of 1 000 pseudoreplicates. Sequences obtained from GenBank are listed by their taxon names followed by accession numbers in the trees (Fig. 1, 2), while newly generated sequences are listed by their isolate number. Newly generated sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Table 1)
