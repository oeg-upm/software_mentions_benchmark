The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS ver.12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All of the comparisons were two-tailed. Means of the two groups were compared using a t-test. Appropriate prognostic parameters were analyzed by Pearson's correlation against the final postoperative visual acuity.
