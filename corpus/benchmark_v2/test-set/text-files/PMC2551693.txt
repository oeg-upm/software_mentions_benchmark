Proteins in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Trisbuffered saline-Tween buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mmol/l NaCl; and 0.05% Tween-20). The membrane was probed with anti-nrf2 antibody (H-300; 1:1,500 dilution) overnight at 4°C. After washing, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:3,000 diluted; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and immunoconjugate was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence. The membrane was then incubated with stripping buffer (100 mmol/l ␤-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween buffer, and reprobed with antibodies to reference proteins ␤-actin and lamin A. Protein band intensities were quantified using Image- Quant TL software (Amersham Biosciences). Characterization of biochemical dysfunction. The intracellular formation of ROS was detected using the fluorogenic probe H 2 DCFDA. Cells (2 ϫ 10 6 ) were incubated with and without sulforaphane and mitochondrial inhibitors for 24 h, washed with PBS, and then incubated further with 20 mol/l H 2 DCFDA for 45 min, washed again, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Shorter incubations of 1-h preincubation in hyperglycemia with and without mitochondrial inhibitors were also performed by microplate fluorescence measurements, normalizing the fluorescence intensity to cell number. The effect of treatments on cell viability was assessed by Trypan blue exclusion.
