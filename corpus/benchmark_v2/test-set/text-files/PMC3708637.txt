Ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional ethical committee for biomedical sciences at the National Institute of Unani Medicine (NIUM), Bangalore. There were 54 enrolled patients. Of the fourteen cases who could not complete the study, one patient of the placebo group died without any known immediate cause. Ten others dropped out from the study within one month of the trial. Three patients of the test group who came from other places returned to their homes for completion of DOTS therapy as they were unable to in Bangalore until the completion of the DOTS regime. Fourteen cases did not complete the study. The remaining 40 patients were equally randomized and matched into Test Group B, DOTS plus adjuvant drug, and Control Group A, DOTS plus adjuvant placebo, by table of random numbers calculated by Stat Trek's Random Number Generator.
Paired t-test was applied to analyze the intra group comparison of pre-and post-treatment variables, and unpaired t-test and Fisher exact test was applied to compare inter groups after treatment variables. SAS 9.2, SPSS 15.0, Stata 10.1,MedCalc 9.0.1, Systat 12.0 and R environment ver.2.11.1 were used for the analysis of the data. Results on continuous measurements are presented on mean ± SD (range) and results on categorical measurements were presented in Number (%). Significant figures were stated as p 0.05. The safety of the treatment was assessed clinically at every visit of follow up and discontinuation of study medication was the prime tool of safety measure. However, there was no such consequence observed which had negative impact on our study.
