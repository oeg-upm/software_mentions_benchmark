All analysis was done using STATA 9.1. The outcome variables were the dispensing cost, willingness to pay, and amount willing to pay for the community pharmacists' dispensing service. Cost was only analysed descriptively. The participant's knowledge of pharmacist dispensing was calculated as the percentage of the activities that the customer selected from the list of activities outlined in Section B. The Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the factors associated with the participants' WTP. The Mann-Whitney U, KruskalWallis, and Spearman correlation tests were used to assess the factors associated with the amount the participants' were willing to pay for the pharmacists' dispensing service. For all statistical tests performed, the significance level was set a priori at P<0.05. Table 1. Description of the nature and benefit of the pharmacists' dispensing service. Assume that you are taking your prescription to a pharmacy for filling. At first, the pharmacist will screen your prescription to identify any potential medication errors, including incorrect medicine usage or possibility of the medicine in the prescription interacting with your condition or other medicine you are taking. Research has found that three out of ten prescriptions have medication errors. It is important to identify and solve these problems because they will lead to adverse reactions, such as rash, diarrhoea or reduced effectiveness of the medicine. Other research by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that there is at least one death per day and 1.3 million people are injured each year due to medication errors, including wrong medicine and improper dose. Here, the role of the pharmacist is to assist you in the prevention of the undesired outcomes by correcting any medication errors through professional screening, counselling and evaluation. The Jonna Briggs Institute in Australia has found that community pharmacists can reduce the risk of medication errors by 20%.
