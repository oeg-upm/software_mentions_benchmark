According to Google Scholar, Jensen (2003) is the most cited empirical study on the relationship between FDI and democracy. It has been cited 650 times, and, as shown in Figure 3, it remains a key reference today. In this section, we investigate the robustness of this study's findings to outliers. 2 The sample covers 112 countries over the period 1970-1997, the dependent variable is FDI inflows as a share of GDP, and the proxy for democracy is Polity IV score (see Table 5 for a description). We focus on the key regression of the paper: model 10 in Table 4. The estimates suggest that a fully autocratic government (score of 0) becoming fully democratic (score of 20) can be expected to attract 0.4% more FDI flows as a percentage of GDP). Given that the average level of FDI flows in the sample is 1.3% of GDP, this is a sizeable amount. Table 4 presents our results. Column (1) replicates perfectly the estimates found in Jensen (2003). In column (2), we remove the observations identified as outliers by the Cook distance, which is a scaled measure of the distance between the coefficient vectors when a given observation is omitted. Five percent of the observations are deemed to be outliers. Their omission has no qualitative impact on the results. In column (3) we use an M-estimator, which gives a lower weight to observations with large standardized residuals but is not robust to leverage points. The estimated impact of democracy falls by half. In column (4), the M-estimator is used again, but the sample now only includes observations that have not been identified as outliers, and, therefore, potential leverage points, in column (2). This is essentially what the Stata command -rreg-is doing.
