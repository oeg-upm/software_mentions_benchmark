An activity chamber (60 × 60 × 30 cm) with a black floor divided into 16 squares of an equal area (15 × 15 cm) by white lines was used to study 3'-dA-induced hyperactivity. After 3 days of i.p. injection of drugs, mice were placed in the center of the chamber and their behavior was recorded for 60 minutes. Total distance traveled and the amount of distance traveled in the center area (the 4-square area in the middle of the chamber) were analyzed by Anymaze system (Stoelting).
PFC or HIP tissue was lysed with an ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, sodium pyrophosphate, β-glycerophosphate, EDTA, Na 3 VO 4, leupeptin plus a Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet [Roche], and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet [Roche]) in a tissue grinder (Wheaton). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to 7-10% SDS-PAGE gels electrophoresis, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Pall) and blocked with 1% BSA in TBST (0.1% Tween). Antibodies against Phos-GluR1 S845 (Rabbit mAb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and GluR1 (Goat pAb, 1:1000, Santa Cruz) in 5% BSA-TBST were applied to the membranes. The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:5000, Affinity Bioscience) or donkey anti-goat antibodies (1:5000, Santa Cruz). Antibody for β-actin (Mouse mAb, 0.2 μg/ml, Affinity Bioscience) was applied for loading calibration. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Millipore). Images were acquired by the FlourChem E image system (FE0511, ProteinSimple) and quantified by the Image-Pro Plus Version 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics).
All data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and post hoc Bonferroni (unequal sample) or Tukey (equal sample) tests and presented as the mean ± standard error via SPSS 17. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered a significant difference. Figures were generated by Graphpad Prism Version 5 software.
