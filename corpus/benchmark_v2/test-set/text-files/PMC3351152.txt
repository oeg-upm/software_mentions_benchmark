HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against C7orf30 were seeded at 3 Â 10 4 cells/well in 200 ml growth medium in XF 24-well cell culture microplates (Seahorse Bioscience) and incubated at 37 C in 5% CO 2 for 36-40 h. One hour before the assay growth medium was removed and replaced with assay medium (low buffered DMEM, 10 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glucose), with one wash of assay medium, and left to stabilize in a 37 C non-CO 2 incubator. Analysis was performed in quadruplicate using a XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). The wells were sequentially injected with 20 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) to inhibit glycolysis, 100 nM oligomycin to inhibit ATP-synthase, 500-1000 nM carbonylcyanide-4-trifluorometho-xyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) to uncouple the respiratory chain, and 200 nM rotenone to inhibit complex I. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured for each well every 5 min. before and after each injection. Test compounds: 2-DG, oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone were all obtained from Sigma. 35 S-methionine metabolic labelling of mitochondrial proteins HeLa cells transfected with siRNA against C7orf30 or stably transfected HEK293T cells expressing C7orf30. FLAG.STREP2 or mutants thereof were induced with doxycycline (50 ng/ml) for 3 days prior to 35 S labelling. Growth medium was replaced with methionine/cysteinefree DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 48 mg/ml cysteine and 50 mg/ml uridine. The cells were incubated for 2 Â 10 min in this medium, then transferred to methionine/cysteine-free DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) dialysed FCS and emetine dihydrochloride (100 mg/ml). Cells were incubated for 10 min before addition of 120 mCi/ml of [ 35 S]-methionine. Labelling was performed for 15 min and the cells were washed twice with standard growth medium. Protein samples (30 mg) were separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels, with products visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager system in ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare).
In order to establish whether OXPHOS defects observed upon inactivation of C7orf30 Figure 4) were a result of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we inhibited cytosolic translation and labelled de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with 35 S-Met. The incorporation of radioactive 35 S-Met into mitochondrial proteins was analysed 6 days after the HeLa cells were transfected with C7orf30 siRNA. Translation of all mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits was compromised upon C7orf30 gene silencing, with incorporation of 35 S-Met reduced by <60% (for the more potent C7orf30 siRNA oligo 1) as compared to controls transfected with an unrelated siRNA (Figure 5A). In order to investigate whether inactivation of C7orf30 has an effect on the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of lysates from HeLa cells transfected with C7orf30 siRNA for 6 days and control cells transfected with an unrelated siRNAwere quantified for C7orf30-depleted cells using ImageQuant software. Relative abundance is presented as a percentage of the steady-state level for control cells transected with an unrelated siRNA. n = 3, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001; two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test error bars = 1 SD. (C) OCR in C7orf30-depleted cells. OCR measured in an extracellular flux Seahorse instrument in control cells transfected with an unrelated siRNA or cells treated with siRNA to C7orf30 for 6 days. The wells containing cells were sequentially injected with 20 mM 2-DG to inhibit glycolysis, 100 nM oligomycin to inhibit ATP-synthase, 1 mM FCCP to uncouple the respiratory chain and 200 nM rotenone to inhibit complex I. n = 6, error bars = 1 SD. (D) Steady-state levels of mitochondrial transcripts upon inactivation of C7orf30. Total RNA from control cells (Ctrl) and cells transfected with two siRNAs specific for C7orf30 were analysed by northern blots using radioactive probes specific for the indicated mitochondrial transcripts. Nuclear-encoded 28S rRNA was used as a loading control. Figure 5G), consistent with a decrease in monosome formation, presumably due to alterations in mt-LSU integrity. These results, together with the observation that the steady-state levels of mitochondrial rRNAs were not changed (Figure 4D), suggest that the inhibition of mitochondrial translation upon inactivation of C7orf30 could be attributed mainly to instability and/or impaired assembly of the large mitoribosomal subunit, consequently interfering with formation of the mitochondrial monosome.
