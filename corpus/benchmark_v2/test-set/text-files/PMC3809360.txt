Mitochondrial ROS generation was assessed using Mito-Sox red (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). KMS20 cells were seeded onto 30-mm culture dishes at a density of 3 Â 10 5 cells and incubated with 1 mM Mito-Sox for 20 min at 37 1C. For quantitative analysis of ROS generation, Mito-Sox-treated cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCantoII instrument. Fluorescence images of Mito-Sox-loaded cells were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM700, Carl-Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and analyzed using Axiovision microscope software, version 4.8.2 (Carl-Zeiss).
Data were analyzed using the Student's t-test and SigmaPlot 8.0 software; P values were derived to assess statistical significance as follows: *Po0.05; **Po0.01; and ***Po0.001. Data for all figures are expressed as the means±standard deviation (s.d.) of three independent experiments.
