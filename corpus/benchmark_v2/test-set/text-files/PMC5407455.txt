Weidt et al subscores [not WHO environment], and SCL-K-9). Group (treatment history: untreated vs previously treated) served as the between-subject variable, and time (pre, post, follow-up) as the within-subject factor. A significant impact of treatment history can be seen in a significant interaction between group and time. Variables (baseline HDRS-17 and baseline WHOglobal) that had demonstrated baseline differences between both groups (untreated/previously treated) were included as covariates into the analyses, also the variable intervention group (decoupling/PMR). Assumptions for all analyses with GLM-RM were checked in terms of Box's test of equality of covariance matrices, Mauchly's test of sphericity, and Levene's test of equality of error variances. All assumptions were met, with the exception of a significant Box's test for the HDRS-17 and a significant Mauchly's test for the GSI (ITT and completers' analysis), which was considered with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction. Effect sizes (partial η 2 ) were calculated (0.01 small effect, 0.06 medium effect, and 0.14 large effect size). 41 All statistical calculations were performed using the software package SPSS (Version 22.0). The level of significance was set at P0.05 (two-sided).
