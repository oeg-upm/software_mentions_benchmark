Our Edge-LBAM method contains dual procedures, including structure-aware mask-updating guided by predict edges and attention maps generated by masks for feature re-normalization. Extensive experiments show that our Edge-LBAM is effective in generating coherent image structures and preventing color discrepancy and blurriness, and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative metrics and visual quality. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/wds1998/Edge-LBAM.
