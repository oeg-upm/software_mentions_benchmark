To allow for flexible randomisation independent of office hours, randomisation will be performed by using sealed envelopes provided by the sponsor, which are kept at the clinical trial sites. The randomisation code will be generated by the Clinical Trials Unit, Medical Center-University of Freiburg. Randomisation will be performed stratified by trial site, in blocks of variable size in a ratio of 1:1. Block size will be documented separately and will not be disclosed to the sites. The randomisation code will be produced by validated programmes based on the Statistical Analysis System (SAS).
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be prepared. A blind review of the data will be performed after the end of the planned follow-up period without looking at the randomised treatment for each patient. If the statistical analysis plan contains any changes to the analyses outlined in the trial protocol, they will be marked as such, and reasons for amendments will be given. All statistical programming for analysis will be performed with the SAS.
