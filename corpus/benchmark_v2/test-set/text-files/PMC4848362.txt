Statistical analyses were performed using theSPSS software version 20. The variables were investigated using visual (histograms, probability plots) and analytical methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) to determine whether they were normally distributed. Descriptive analyses were presented using means and standard deviations (SD) for normally distributed variables, medians and maximum-minimum values for non-normally distributed variables, and percentages for cat-egorical variables. Chi-square (Ï‡ 2 ), Student's t, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used where appropriate. A Spearman correlation analysis was performed to determine the association of RDW with the examined variables. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to identify the significance of the relationship of RDW levels with microalbuminuria, LVMI, and eGFR. An overall 5% type-I error level was used to infer statistical significance.
