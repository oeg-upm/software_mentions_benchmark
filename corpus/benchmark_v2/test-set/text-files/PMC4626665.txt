The behavioral data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression in IBM SPSS 20.0 (2012). We recode the behavior categories from 1 to 4 for activities and 5 to 8 for positions as follows: 1) resting; 2) browsing; 3) filtering; 4) thrashing; 5) surface; 6) bottom; 7) wall; and 8) middle, which were then modeled as being dependent on prey species (Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and An. sinensis) and treatments (control, freeroaming predator, and residual kairomones remnant).
