Data were measured as the cycle number at which logarithmic PCR plots cross a calculated threshold line (CT) and used to determine ⌬CT values [(⌬CT of the target gene) Ϫ (⌬CT of the housekeeping gene). Data were expressed as arbitrary units (AU) using the following transformation: expression ϭ 10 5 ϫ (2 Ϫ⌬CT ) AU. Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means Ϯ SE unless otherwise stated. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed using the trapezoidal method. For comparison of single variables, t tests have been used (or nonparametric equivalents where data were not normally distributed). Regression analyses were performed using Pearson correlations; where more than one variable was considered, multiple linear regression analysis was used. All analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3.1 (Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA).
