One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparison of SWV among the 3 groups (patients with spasticity, patients without spasticity and healthy subjects), whereas Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) was used for multiple comparisons. Betweengroup comparisons for continuous data were assessed with Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate. We evaluated correlation of spasticity with SWV by assessing the Spearman rank correlation coefficients. The interclass correlation coefficient was used to examine intra-raterwww.e-arm.org reliability of repeated ARFI. Data were expressed as the meanÂ±standard deviation. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. All statistical tests were conducted using the SPSS ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
