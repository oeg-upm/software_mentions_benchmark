A descriptive analysis was conducted to show the characteristics of the 134 subjects. Data were summarized as mean and standard deviation, median and interquartile range, or frequencies and percentages as appropriate. Comparisons among groups on the crude values of oxysterols were made using one-way ANOVA. Tukey's multiple comparison post-hoc test was then used to determine significant differences between the groups. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21 software (IBM Corporation). Table 1 summarizes the demographics, clinical features and sperm characteristics of 134 subjects enrolled in the study. The four groups did not differ in term of ejaculate volume. As expected from the enrolling procedure, semen parameters were significantly different between the four groups.
