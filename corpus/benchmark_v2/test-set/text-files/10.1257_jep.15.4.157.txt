I turn now to the question of how the econometrician can possibly estimate an equation like the GARCH(1,1) when the only variable on which there are data is r t . The simple answer is to use maximum likelihood by substituting h t for 2 in the normal likelihood and then maximizing with respect to the parameters. An even simpler answer is to use software such as EViews, SAS, GAUSS, TSP, Matlab, RATS and many others where there exist already packaged programs to do this.
First, we construct the hypothetical historical portfolio. (All calculations in this example were done with the EViews software program.) Figure 1 shows the pattern of returns of the Nasdaq, Dow Jones, bonds and the composite portfolio leading up to the terminal date. Each of these series appears to show the signs of ARCH effects in that the amplitude of the returns varies over time. In the case of the equities, it is clear that this has increased substantially in the latter part of the sample period. Visually, Nasdaq is even more extreme. In Table 1, we present some illustrative statistics for each of these three investments separately and for the portfolio as a whole in the final column. From the daily standard deviation, we see that the Nasdaq is the most volatile and interest rates the least volatile of the assets. The portfolio is less volatile than either of the equity series even though it is 80 percent equity-yet another illustration of the benefits of diversification. All the assets show evidence of fat tails, since the kurtosis exceeds 3, which is the normal value, and evidence of negative skewness, which means that the left tail is particularly extreme.
