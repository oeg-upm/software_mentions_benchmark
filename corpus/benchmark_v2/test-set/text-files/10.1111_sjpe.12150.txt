Identification of the average treatment effect on the treated through DD models relies on the parallel trend assumption so that values of our outcome of interest, well-being defined via the GHQ, should follow similar pre-treatment time trends in both Scotland and England. To examine whether this assumption holds, we display GHQ trends by country of residence, gender, marital status and the presence of dependent children in Figure 1. For the overall population (which includes both married and single individuals with and without children, upper part of Figure 1), GHQ trends appear to be broadly similar in Scotland and England before the introduction of the bans. More specifically, while for Scottish and English women GHQ trends appear to slightly converge between waves 14 and 15 (i.e. 1 year before the introduction of the ban in Scotland, although this change amounts to less than a half GHQ point), pre-Scottish ban trends appear very similar for male individuals. 15 Both graphs show that in the year when the Scottish ban was introduced (between waves 15 and 16), GHQ levels in Scotland appear to decrease (implying a small increase in SWB), especially among women. Still for the overall population sample of men, SWB also appears to somewhat increase in England after the smoking ban. Graphs for married individuals of both genders (second row of Figure 1) appear to display GHQ trends comparable to the ones of the overall population. Single women in Scotland and England (third row of Figure 1) show virtually identical self-reported GHQ trends, also during the introduction of the two bans with slight increases in SWB between waves 15 and 16 (Scottish ban) followed by decreases in SWB between waves 16 and 17 (English ban). However, SWB reported by single men seem to vary during the pre-Scottish ban period, although only between GHQ scores of 10 and 11. Men and women with children (fourth row of Figure 1) exhibit relatively stable differences in GHQ levels between England and Scotland before the Scottish ban with increases in SWB during the Scottish ban and simultaneous slight decreases in England. However, the very stable GHQ levels 14 In this case, we use England in wave 9 as a baseline country-specific time trend as no public smoking ban was in place at that time. Treatment effects are computed using differences between estimated interaction terms, i.e. interactions between country of residence and time dummies, before and after the Scottish ban in England and Scotland. More specifically, the corresponding treatment effect reported in each table is the one obtained by the following double difference: (Scotland*wave 16 -England*wave 16) -(Scotland*wave 15 -England*wave 15) where waves 15 and 16 are the pre-and post-Scottish ban waves in the BHPS respectively. Standard errors for these treatment effects are obtained using the lincom command in Stata. 15 The presence of anticipation effects on well-being is explored using placebo tests in Table 7.among men and women without children (last row) do not appear to be affected by the introduction of the smoking bans. Overall, we observe mostly stable pre-treatment trends and increases in SWB in the year of the implementation of the Scottish ban, especially among women. Yet, specific sub-groups display some, although limited, variation in pre-treatment GHQ trends (e.g. single men) while others present no apparent changes in GHQ levels in the presence of the bans (e.g. men with no children).
