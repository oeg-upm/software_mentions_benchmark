FTIR spectroscopy Spectra were recorded in the mid-infrared region (3200-900 cm À1 ) by a Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Massachusetts, USA). A nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector and an attenuated total reflection cell, Harric BioATRcell II , with a silicon crystal were used. The temperature of the attenuated total reflection cell was 30°C. Spectra were recorded using OPUS software version 7.2 (Bruker, Massachusetts, USA). Gastric aspirate (20 lL) was transferred to a fresh vial containing 20 lL of internal standard (potassium thiocyanate 1 g/L). Then, 6 lL of this mixture was applied to the attenuated total reflection crystal. The sample was dried for two minutes under a gentle stream of air (40-45°C). Each sample was applied twice, and for each application, two spectra were recorded. The mean value of the four spectra was calculated, and the baseline was corrected and normalised with respect to the potassium thiocyanate peak at 2.000-2.110 cm À1 . The spectroscopy after pre-analytic handling of each sample was completed in less than 10 minutes.
