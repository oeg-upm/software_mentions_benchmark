Trained research assistants administered whole-body DXA scans with Hologic model Discovery A (Hologic, Bedford, MA) that they checked for quality control on visit days. We used Hologic software version 12.6 for scan analysis. A single trained research assistant checked all scans for positioning, movement, and artifacts and defined body regions for analysis. Intrarater reliability was high (r = 0.99). We calculated the DXA fat mass and fat-free mass indexes using the following formula: [total DXA fat mass (or fat free mass) in kg]/(height in meters) 2 (24). We also calculated the DXA trunk to peripheral fat mass ratio, a measure of central adiposity (25,26). Covariates. During pregnancy and in late childhood, using a combination of questionnaires and interviews, we obtained information about maternal age, race/ ethnicity, education, parity, smoking during pregnancy, marital status, and household income. We collected information from prenatal medical records on serial pregnancy weights and blood pressure readings and infant birth weight and delivery date. Mothers reported their prepregnancy weight and height and the paternal weight and height. We calculated gestational weight gain as the difference between prepregnancy weight and the last clinically recorded weight before delivery. We derived gestational age from the last menstrual period or from the second trimester ultrasound if the two estimates differed by .10 days. Based on U.S. national natality data, we determined sexspecific birth weight for gestational age z scores (27).
