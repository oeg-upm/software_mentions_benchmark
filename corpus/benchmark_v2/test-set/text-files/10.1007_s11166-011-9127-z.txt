All experimental sessions were conducted at the Behavioral and Experimental Economics laboratory Maastricht (BEELab) with 121 (65 male, 56 female) students from Maastricht University. The vast majority (88%) were students from Economics and Business Administration. The other subjects were students from Law, Cultural Sciences, and from University College Maastricht. They were recruited through email announcements and announcements on the students' intranet. Each subject participated in only one session. The experiment was programmed in Z-tree (Fischbacher 2007).
