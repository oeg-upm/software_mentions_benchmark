a method reported previously (Mori et al., 2008). This method yielded B-ring-modified esters as the major products except linolenate ester (C18TE). In case of synthesis of saturated fatty acid monoesters, the ratio of regioisomers was consistent regardless of the alkyl chain length. Unsaturated fatty acid esters and dioctanoyl esters (C8 Ã— 2) were also synthesized, and the ratio of their regioisomers is summarized in Table 1. Mixtures of these isomers were used without isolation because they have similar chemical properties and the antiviral activities of these mixtures did not vary with their composition ratio (Mori et al., 2008). Log P values were calculated by a software; ChemBioDraw Ultra ver. 11 and used as lipophilicity index Table 1). Higher log P means higher lipophilicity. The derivatives were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with distilled water.
