Methods. Identification of prior research studies was performed using the search terms: anxiety; BC; marital relationship; spouse; MQ; Middle East; and KSA in various combinations. These search words were entered into PubMed and Google Scholar to locate all relevant studies. A convenience sample of women with BC (volunteers) was recruited between January 2013 and March 2013 from King Abdulaziz University's (KAU) Sheikh Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi Breast Cancer Center of Excellence in Jeddah, KSA. Consecutive women presenting to the outpatient clinic for initial assessment or follow-up were approached for inclusion in the study. The inclusion criteria were: age 18 to 65 years; diagnosis of BC documented in the medical record; currently married; and attending the clinic on the day that the interviewers were present in the clinic. The exclusion criteria were women without BC, those outside the age range above, those who were not currently married, and all those being seen on days and times when interviewers were not present. The average length of time that participants were diagnosed with and/or experienced symptoms of BC were 38.4 months (range 2 weeks to 180 months). The questionnaire was translated into Arabic, and was self-completed by participants. Medical students (trained by KAU psychiatry faculty on how to approach patients, obtain consent, and administer the questionnaire) explained the study to the participants and obtained informed consent before proceeding. The institutional review board of KAU Hospital approved the study following the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.
Statistical analyses. The characteristics of the sample were described by means + standard deviations (SD) or percentages Table 1). A correlation matrix (Pearson r) was constructed for all study variables Table 2). In multivariate analyses, income was dichotomized into low (<3,000=0) versus high (>3,000=1), and education was dichotomized into low (0=no education or only primary school) versus high (one=high school or beyond). Blocks of independent variables were entered in a stepwise fashion into 3 general linear models predicting the dependent variable (anxiety symptoms): model one included only the sample demographics (age, nationality, education, employment, income); model 2 included demographics and cancer-related factors; and model 3 included demographics, cancerrelated factors, and overall MQ Table 3). Given the sample size, only independent variables significant at p<0.10 were carried forward into later models. Since these analyses were largely exploratory, the significance level was set at p=0.05, and analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
