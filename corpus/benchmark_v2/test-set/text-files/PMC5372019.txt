Statistical analytic approach for primary aim Survival curves are generated by the Cox proportional hazards regression model and survival among groups will be compared using the log-rank test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is used to evaluate the effect of influential factors on the occurrence of MACEs. A two-sided significance level of 5% is defined as the level of statistical significance. The analyses are conducted with SAS software, V.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
Data entry and management of data files All data are entered into computerised database withSAS software, V.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Values that are out of range or represent errors of faulty logic are avoided by double check.
