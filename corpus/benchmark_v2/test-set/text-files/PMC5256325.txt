Primary comparisons were performed between the favorable and non-favorable groups. The data were expressed as the mean±standard deviation or as percentages. The categorical variables were compared using the χ 2 and the Fisher exact test. The continuous variables were compared using the two-tailed unpaired Student t-test for the variables with normal distributions, and the twotailed Mann-Whitney U test was used for the variables with non-normal distributions. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was then performed. The logistic regression coefficients were used to assess the odds ratios for each independent variable. The entire statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS ver. 19 for Windows (IBM SPSS Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). A p-value smaller than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference.
