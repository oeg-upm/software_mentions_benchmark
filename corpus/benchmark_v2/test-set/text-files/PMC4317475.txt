Separation of anthocyanins and non-anthocyanins was conducted on a reverse-phase Capcell Pak C18 UG 120 S5 column (4.6×150 mm I.D., 4 μm; Shiseido Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) using a Finnigan Surveyor high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Thermo Quest, San Jose, CA, USA) at an ambient temperature. The mobile phase was a binary elution of 5% formic acid solution (A) and 100% methanol (B) under the following gradient conditions: initial, 20% B; 7 min, 20% B; 15 min, 25% B; 32 min, 50% B; 36 min, 100% B; 38 min, 100% B; 40 min, 20% B and 45 min, 20% B. The flow rate was 700 μl/min, and the injection volume was 10 μl. Eluted substances were detected at 280 nm and 570 nm by using a photodiodearray detector between 200 and 600 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm. For the identification of major components, the column elute was split, and 0.2 ml·min -1 was directed to a Finnigan LCQ Advantage ion-trap MS (Thermo Quest, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface after passing through the flow cell of the photodiode-array detector. Analysis was carried out using positive ion monitoring at a capillary temperature of 280°C, spray voltage of 5.5 kV, capillary voltage of 10 V and tube lens offset of -5.0 V. Spectral data were recorded using He gas as a collision gas. Anthocyanins and non-anthocyanins were detected using m/z value following MS/MS. The MS/MS collision energy was set to 35%. Data were collected using dual analysis in fullscan mode from 100 to 1000 atomic mass units and MS/MS modes. Data were processed using the Xcalibur 2.0 version software program (Thermo Electron Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA).
For gene expression profiling, the synthesis of target cRNA probes and hybridization were performed using Agilent's Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technnology, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescent-labeled cRNA target was quantified using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). The hybridization images were analyzed by Agilent DNA microarray Scanner (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the data quantification was performed using Agilent Feature Extraction software
          9.3.2.1 (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The average fluorescence intensity for each spot was calculated and local background was subtracted. All data normalization and selection of fold-changed genes were performed using GeneSpringGX 7.3.1 (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
