We adopted Pearson Ï‡ 2 test or Fisher's exact test to assess the correlations between clinicopathological variables and IMA subtypes. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. Recurrence-free survival and overall survival were compared using log-rank test. Cox regression was performed to assess the effect of clinicopathological characteristics, including IMA subtypes, upon survival.The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All the tests were two-tailed, and statistical significance was set as P,0.05.
