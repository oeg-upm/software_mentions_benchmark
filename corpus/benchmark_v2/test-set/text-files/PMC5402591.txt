Per-protocol analysis was conducted to evaluate the treatment effect. The baseline characteristics were presented as absolute number (percentage) or mean (standard deviation). To compare baseline characteristics between groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare differences between pre-and posttraining outcomes within each group. Changes from baseline of each outcome measure between groups were compared using linear regression analysis. A 2-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
