Continuous variables were compared using Student t test and dichotomous variables using the chi-square test. Survival time was measured from the date of surgical resection to the date of death or last contact. Conventional clinical variables at the time of entry into the study and immunopositivity for PDI were analyzed to identify factors that influenced survival, as determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Stepwise, univariate, and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify factors that influenced survival. Variables found to be significantly associated with the outcome in the univariate analyses were included in the multivariate analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19
