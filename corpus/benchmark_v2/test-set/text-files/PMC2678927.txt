All SNPs were tested for significant deviation from HardyWeinberg equilibrium in controls and all passed the test with P-values . 0.05. The SNPs were analyzed for an association with the disease by means of comparison of the minor allele frequency in patients and controls (basic allelic test) as well as other tests using Plink (18). LD patterns were analyzed and displayed by HaploView (20). Association of the SNPs with disease risk was also corrected by logistic regression using age and sex as covariates and the associations found in this study remain significant after all the corrections. Average ORs and P-values jointly analyzed from both the Hong Kong Chinese and the Thai populations were obtained by CMH test of association conditional on SNP differences between the two populations. Potential heterogeneity of ORs for a given SNP between the two populations was tested both by Breslow -Day test and by partitioning the x 2 statistic between the two populations. Test of independent contribution of a SNP controlling for the effect of other SNPs in the same gene was done by logistic regression as well as haplotype analyses. Association with subphenotype was analyzed by comparing cases with a certain subphenotype with controls, cases without the subphenotype with controls, heterogeneity test of two ORs so derived and direct comparison of the cases with and without the subphenotypes.
