CLC Genomics Workbench CLC bio using paired-end libraries with 350-bp fragments. Reads were quality fi ltered, and the adapters were removed using libngs (https://github.com/ sylvainforet/libngs) using a minimum quality of 25 bp and a minimum read size of 150 bp. The genomic assemblies were carried out with SPAdes ( Bankevich et al., 2012 ) using the following options: "-k 21,33,55,77,99,127-careful -t 16 -m 64".
To design phylogenetic markers that are broadly applicable, we focused primer design on common regions of high sequence homology. Initially, we compared the four Sebacina isolates from Eriochilus against the C. huegelii isolate within CLC Genomics Workbench software. This allowed us to target the high homology sequence regions shared across the fi ve isolates for positioning the primers. Out of the 58,295 successful reads of Sebacina from C. huegelii , there were 1251 shared reads with E. pulchellus (average length 285 bp) and 950 to 1605 shared reads with E. dilatatus isolates (average length 1 Manuscript (LP110100408http://www.bioone.org/loi/apps profi le was used consisting of a 3-min denaturation at 94 ° C; followed by 12 touchdown cycles at 94 ° C (30 s) with the fi rst annealing temperature at 66 ° C (40 s) (−3 ° C/second cycle) and a primer extension at 72 ° C (1 min); then 30 cycles at 94 ° C (30 s), 48 ° C (40 s), 72 ° C (1 min); with a fi nal extension at 72 ° C for 20 min. Products were sequenced bidirectionally with ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator version 3.1 sequencing kit on an ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California, USA). Sequences were edited using the program Sequencher version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) and aligned in Geneious Pro version 6.1.6 ( Drummond et al., 2011 ). Consistent and high-quality amplifi cation of all tested Sebacina isolates occurred for eight primer sets ( Table 2 ). Estimates of variability across the alignment of up to 31 sequences were performed withinMEGA version 5.2 ( Tamura et al., 2011 ). The eight markers revealed 15-40% nucleotide diversity and 11-31% parsimony informative sites across these sequences ( Table 2 ).
Phylogenetic analyses -A multiple sequence alignment was constructed using the alignment tool in Geneious Pro version 6.1.6 ( Drummond et al., 2011 ) before performing manual checks and minor adjustments. Phylogenies of individual and concatenated loci were estimated with a maximum likelihood (ML) analysis using RAxML 7.0.3 ( Stamatakis et al., 2008 ). Support for nodes was assessed for ML trees using 1000 pseudoreplicates of nonparametric bootstrapping in RAxML. A GTR+G substitution model was used for all analyses as all other models are nested inside this model. Trees were visualized using FigTree version  1.3.1 ( http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/ fi gtree/) and midpoint rooted. Among the 31 isolates, eight to 12 well-supported clades were identifi ed with the newly developed loci ( Fig. 1, Appendices S1-S7).
