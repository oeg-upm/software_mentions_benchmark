To enhance the comparability of our findings with those from other studies, we fit 2 types of models, 1 with parental ages categorized into 6 categories: <20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40 years; and the other with parental age as a continuous variable with the odds ratio scaled to reflect a 10-year difference in age (4). Although we found the association between parental age and autism risk to be similar across the 10 sites, to adjust for potential site-to-site variability we included site dummy variables in all multivariable models. To evaluate interaction or modifying effects of each covariate and of ASD subtypes on the associations between parental age and ASD, we performed stratified analyses. We also tested interaction terms for maternal age by paternal age and 2-way and 3-way interaction terms for each parent's age by the other covariates in the regression models, but we identified no significant interactions. SAS version 9.1.3 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) was used for all statistical analyses.
