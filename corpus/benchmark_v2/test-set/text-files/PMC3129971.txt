DNA samples from all subjects were obtained from peripheral blood leukocytes using a salting out procedure. All coding regions of the PXR gene were analyzed in addition to three variants in non-coding regions that had a minor allele frequency of at least $ 0.10 in other ethnic groups. We also looked for three variants, which modified the PXR and/or CYP3A4 expression, previously described in non-coding regions with a minor allele frequency $ 0.10 in other ethnic groups. 4,17 The PXR gene was amplified as previously described. 4,18 The amplified products were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator Sequencing Kit TM (Applied Biosystem, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) and capillary electrophoresis was conducted on an ABI PRISM 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystem, Inc.). Sequence traces were analyzed using Sequencher (version 4.5 build 1416) and assembled to the reference (NCBI accession number AF364606).
