Data were analyzed using Review Manager version 5.2 provided by Cochrane Collaboration. P,0.05 was considered statistically significant. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed to determine the most suitable model. 40 A randomeffects method was applied when heterogeneity existed; otherwise, a fixed-effects method was used. Cochran's Q-test was performed in order to evaluate homogeneity among studies, and I 2 ,50% or P.0.1 was considered homogeneous. Odds ratios (ORs) were the principal measurements for therapeutic effects and were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
