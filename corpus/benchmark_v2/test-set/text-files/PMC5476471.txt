To do that, H index of a given interleukin was divided by the number of years since publication for the oldest paper included in the H index. A index is the mean number of citations of the papers included in H index (Jin et al., 2007). This indicator was generated simultaneously to H index using WOS software package.
All statistical analyses were done using computer software Prism 6 for Windows (version 6.02; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). One-Way ANOVA was used to detect differences amongst the groups. To account for the non-normal distribution of the data, all data were sorted by rank status prior to ANOVA statistical analysis. Tukey's test was used to compare the means of the ranks among the groups. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Table 1). Because of this high variation, no statistically significant differences were identified between the 39 interleukins. However, it can still be observed that a higher number of articles were found for interleukins 1-18 than for other interleukins. After an analysis of the found articles, we identified several articles which were not linked to the interleukin assessed in the search. These articles can be considered as false positive results and were consequently excluded for further analyses. A list of selected articles was then constituted for each interleukins and each species (supplementary Table 1). In some cases, the difference in the number of articles was quite important. For instance, in bovine IL1, from 271 articles, 223 were kept. These differences illustrate the necessity to check articles one by one.
