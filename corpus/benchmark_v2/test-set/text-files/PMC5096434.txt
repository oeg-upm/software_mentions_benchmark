All participants had demographic, BMI, waist-hip ratio, blood pressure and glucometabolic (cholesterol, triglycerides, BSL, HbA1c, oGTT and IV GTT) data collected at baseline. In addition, the renal transplant recipients had renal specific and transplant specific data collected pretransplant and at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. As outlined in Figure 2, all patients had baseline IV GTT and oGTT tests. Results for glucose and insulin from multiple time points enabled the calculation of glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, insulin secretion and disposition index. Each test was conducted on a different day and after an overnight fast. The renal transplant recipients had these tests conducted within 2 months of renal transplantation. This group also had an IV GTT and oGTT conducted at 3 and 12 months posttransplantation. IV GTT was also performed on day 7 posttransplantation. Any recipient who had been commenced on a hypoglycemic agent had that agent withheld for 72 hours before each test. The oGTT test was conducted by administering 75 g of oral glucose and drawing a venous sample from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the nonarteriovenous fistula arm at 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes. The IV GTT test was conducted by administering 0.3 mg/kg intravenous glucose to a maximum dose of 25 g, diluted in normal saline to a maximum volume of 100 mL. Venous samples were drawn from an intravenous cannula placed in the cubital fossa of the non-arteriovenous fistula arm at −10, −1, +2, +4, +6, +8, +10, +12, +14, +19, +25, +40 minutes. It has previously been established that this dose of intravenous glucose elicits the maximal pancreatic response over this period 21 and similar protocols have been successfully used. 22 Glucose metabolism was assessed by 2 different approaches. Firstly, a comprehensive descriptive analysis was aided by the area under the curve (AUC) of oGTT of each recipient at pretransplant, 3 and 12 months posttransplant. Secondly, an improved understanding of the pathophysiology was gained by assessing the first phase insulin release (FPIR), insulin resistance and β cell responsiveness. FPIR is an index of the β cell response to intravenous glucose (insulinogenic index) and was calculated using the IV GTT by FPIR = (AUC insulin t0-10 minutes)/(Glucose t0minutes − (Av(t-10 minutes and t-1 minutes)) as previously described. 23 Insulin resistance was determined using paired insulin and glucose results obtained from IV GTT, which were then applied to the homeostatic model assessment 2 (HOMA2) calculator, available from https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/ download.php. This has previously been validated in ESKD patients. 24 Insulin sensitivity is the inverse of insulin resistance. The DI (IV) was calculated as the FPIR/insulin resistance. The DI (IV) is a measure of β cell responsiveness and has been shown in the general population to bepredictive of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in those at clinically increased risk. 25 Disposition index relates insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance in a hyperbolic relationship such that an increase an insulin resistance is associated with a compensatory increase in insulin secretion to maintain normoglycemia. 18 At the time of transplantation, recipients received 20 mg basiliximab on days 0 and 4, 500 mg intravenous methylprednisolone on day 0 followed by 30 mg daily of oral prednisolone which was weaned after 3 weeks by 2.5 mg every 2 weeks to a target dose of 5 mg daily. All recipients received 1 g twice a day of mycophenolate mofetil and a CNI, however, the choice of agent was at the discretion of the treating transplant physician. For those who received cyclosporin, the starting dose was 4 mg/kg twice a day with a C2 target of 1200 for the first month, 800 to 1000 at 3 months and 400 to 600 at 12 months. For those who received tacrolimus, the starting dose was 0.075 mg/kg twice a day with a trough tacrolimus target of 8 to 10 for the first month and 5 to 8 at 3 months. All recipients received protocol cytomegalovirus and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. Renal transplant biopsies were conducted as protocol at 3 months or as indicated by clinical criteria. Acute cellular rejection was treated with oral prednisolone 300, 200, and 100 mg over 3 consecutive days. To comprehensively assess immunosuppression burden weekly therapeutic drug levels for CNI agents were collected and the cumulative exposure determined by calculating the AUC.
Data is represented as median and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Continuous variables between groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher exact test. Significance level of 0.05 was not corrected for multiple comparisons due to explorative nature of the study. All analyses were performed using Stata 13.
