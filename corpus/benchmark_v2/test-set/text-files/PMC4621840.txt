Yeast cultures were imaged after growth at 30°C to mid-log phase in synthetic defined media supplemented with either 2% glucose (SD plus glucose) or 2% galactose plus 2% raffinose (SD plus galactose/ raffinose; the latter for induction of Num1 CC , Pac1, or Kip2, as indicated). To assess the effects of Num1 CC on localization of dynein pathway components, GAL1p:num1 CC cells were induced in SD plus galactose/raffinose for 6 h before mounting cells for fluorescence microscopy. For wide-field fluorescence microscopy, yeast cells were imaged on an agarose pad containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and images were collected at room temperature using a 1.49 NA 100× objective on a Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a Ti-S-E motorized stage (Nikon), piezo Z-control (Physik Instrumente), a SOLA SM II LE LED light engine (Lumencor), a motorized filter cube turret, and an iXon X3 DU897 cooled EM-CCD camera (Andor). The microscope system was controlled by NIS-Elements software (Nikon). A step size of 1 µm was used to acquire 2-µm-thick Z-stack images. Sputtered/ET filter cube sets (Chroma Technology) were used for imaging mTurquoise2 (49001), GFP (49002), YFP (49003), and mCherry (49008) fluorescence.
Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health; kymographs in Fig. 7 were generated with the MultipleKymograph plugin). Plus end and SPB foci were identified in two (or three) color movies and scored accordingly. Specifically, plus end molecules were recognized as those foci that localized to the distal tips of dynamic microtubules (identified via mTurquoise2-Tub1 imaging), whereas SPB molecules were recognized as those foci that localized to one of the spindle poles. Cortical molecules (e.g., in PH-Dyn1-expressing cells) were identified as those foci not associated with an astral microtubule plus end that remained stationary at the cell cortex for at least three frames. Two data sets were considered statistically significant if a Student's t test (assuming unequal variance) returned a p-value < 0.05.
