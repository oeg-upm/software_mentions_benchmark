The systematic review studies were assessed with AMSTAR (A program that assesses the quality of the articles in 11 different areas.), and the clinical trials were assessed with CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool) (15,16).
The statistical analyses were done viaSTATA version 11. Indicators for assessing the clinical trials were risk ratio (RR) or odds ratio (OR). For the high-risk group, we did not find enough studies to assess clinical outcomes through RR or OR, so, we assessed the vaccine immunogenicity and analysis was performed on the response rate to the antigen. For calculating the vaccine efficacy, we used RR-1 formula (17). Moreover, publication biases of the studies were assessed via Funnel-plot with regression asymmetry test (Egger's test). Heterogeneity of the studies was assessed with Cochrane Q-test. All pooled estimates were calculated by random effect model (except the cases of no significant heterogeneity). Subgroups were determined based on four strategies for the vaccination program.
