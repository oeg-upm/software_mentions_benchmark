Patients. The design of the clinical trial has been previously described. 49 Briefly, our single-arm trial used induction gemcitabine (1 g/m 2 ) on day 1 and day 8 and carboplatin (AUC = 5) on day 1 given at 4-week intervals for two cycles. This was followed by weekly carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m 2 ) with concurrent conformal radiation (dose = 74 Gy ± 5%) administered over 40 daily fractions. Plasma was collected at baseline (Time 0), after induction at week 9 (Time 1), and afterindividual mean concentrations were recorded. The intraassay and day-to-day analytic coefficients of variation were less than 5% for each analyte (Table S1). Statistics. The plasma concentrations of Kyn and Trp, as well as Kyn/Trp ratios approximated a parametric distribution. Therefore, data were presented as means ± SD. Due to the small sample size, the associations between serum biomarker levels and clinicopathologic variables were evaluated with Wilcoxon ranksum and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Wilcoxon signed rank was used to compare between time points. Correlation was estimated using Spearman's rho. Survival curves were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. To address the experimental hypothesis, the statistical population was equally divided into "hig" and "low" patients using the median Kyn/Trp value as pre-specified cut-point. The effects of biomarkers on PFS and OS were evaluated using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Cox proportionalhazards regression models. All tests performed were two-tailed. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS software (version8.0). Figures and survival plots were generated using GraphPad Prism ® (version 5.04).
