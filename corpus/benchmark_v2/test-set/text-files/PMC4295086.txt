Carcass transport. We simulated the movement of carcasses from farms to processing plants directly or indirectly, through intermediate plants, following the scheme shown in the Fig. 1. We estimated the distance travelled by carcasses using the main national paved road network and the network analysis extension in ArcGIS 10.1. As the location of each farm was not available, we considered the center of each 10 3 10 km grid to be the point of origin (i.e., the farm) from which carcasses were moved. From these points, we calculated the distance travelled by trucks to the nearest plant. If this plant was a processing plant, then carcass movement was considered complete. If this plant was an intermediate plant, another truck was used to completethe transport of the carcasses to processing plants. In our analysis, movements from farms (i.e., grid centers) to intermediate or processing plants were performed daily, using 7.5 t rigid trucks of 230 hp, while movements from intermediate to processing plants occurred weekly and used 24 t articulated trucks of 340 hp. Vehicle types were determined by direct information from companies and regional regulations. We assumed that daily trucks collected all the carcasses generated within a grid cell until they reached their full load (7.5 t). Trucks moving carcasses from intermediate to processing plants were also completely loaded. Typically, more than one truck per week moved from an intermediate plant to a processing plant. All trips were calculated twice, as trucks must make the same trip in both directions. Intermediate and processing plants were geographically located using information provided by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment and the Autonomous Communities 35. Distance calculations were made using the shortest road between origin and destination points (i.e., farms to intermediate or processing plants, and intermediate plants to processing plants), and prioritizing road type from highest to lowest speed (i.e., highways, national roads, autonomic roads, streets, and unpaved roads) 36. GHG emissions. During the combustion process, most carbon is immediately emitted as CO 2 , although other GHG such as N 2 O and CH 4 are also produced. Thus, we calculated the emissions of these three gases separately as E(i) 5 AD * EF(i), where i is the gas type (CO 2 , CH 4 or N 2 O), AD is activity data and EF is the emission factor, 73.7 t/TJ for CO 2 37 and 0.0039 t/TJ for CH 4 and N 2 O 24 . Activity data (AD) was calculated as FC * FD * LHV, where FC is fuel consumption, FD is fuel density and LHV is lower heat value. FD (0.845 kg/l) and LHV (0.0424 TJ/t) were obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment 33 . FC was calculated by multiplying the distance covered by each truck by the expected average fuel consumption per km expected by each type of truck 24. We considered that all trucks of the same type consumed the same quantity of fuel per km regardless of their load (0.21 l/km for trucks used to move carcasses from farms to the nearest plant and 0.26 l/km for trucks used to move carcasses from intermediate plants to processing plants) 38. We assumed that all trucks used oil/diesel fuel and were 11 yrs old, such that motors are thermally stabilized and do not have catalysts. These assumptions are based on the fact that in 2011, ca. 90% of trucks and vans in Spain were diesels, and their average age was 11 yrs old 39. As fuel combustion is not perfect and a small portion may lead to residuals (ash and soot), we included an ''oxidation factor'' which expresses the ratio of CO 2 emitted per fuel unit (0.99) 37. Results are presented as CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 eq.), a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO 2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP) when measured over a specified timescale (100 years) 24. GWP values for CH 4 and N 2 O were 34 and 298, respectively, with climate-carbon feedback values and lifetimes taken from 40. CO 2 eq. is expressed as parts per million by volume and referred to the 10 3 10 km grid cell where carcasses originated.
Scavenger distribution. We used data available from the Spanish National Biodiversity Inventory 33 to map the distribution of obligate scavengers (i.e., griffon Gyps fulvus, cinereous Aegypius monachus, Egyptian Neophron percnopterus and bearded vultures Gypaetus barbatus) across Spain. We focused on the breeding population, which represents approximately two-thirds of the total vulture population. We calculated the distance of each 10 3 10 km grid center to the nearest breeding site (i.e., nest or colony) of any obligate scavenger. Because of the high daily mobility of these species (griffon vultures: up to 70 km from breeding sites; cinereous vultures: up to 86 km from breeding sites; bearded vultures: up to 45 km from breeding sites; Egyptian vultures: up to 70 km from breeding sites) 12,41, we also calculated their richness (i.e., number of species) in a 100 km buffer around each 10 3 10 km grid cell. We used Generalized Linear Models (1/mu 2 link function and inverse Gaussian error distribution) to explore the relationship between metric tons of CO 2 eq. per grid and distance to the nearest obligate scavenger breeding site. Metric tons of CO 2 eq. in a 100 km buffer around grids with different species richness (from 0 to 4) were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. All analyses were performed in R 42. We used ArcGIS 10.1 to generate maps.
