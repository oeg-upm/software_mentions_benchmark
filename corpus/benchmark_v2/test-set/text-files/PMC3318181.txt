location of the arm node, the crossover rate of the arm node, and the metastatic rate of the arm node were collected from all patients. All analyses were done in SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The effect of arm node preserving surgery on lymphedema was analyzed by paired t-test (in a comparison between arm circumference changes at the last follow-up point of the ipsilateral upper-extremity and contralateral upper-extremity circumference in each group) and by an independent t-test (in a comparison between arm circumference in the ipsilateral upper-extremity of the arm node preserved group and unpreserved group). A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
