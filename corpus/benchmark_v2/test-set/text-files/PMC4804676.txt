Data analysis was performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Chi-square tests were used to determine the bivariate associations with sweat test outcome (QNS v. non-QNS) and the following variables: birth weight, gestational age, race, NICU admission, and CF care center. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to determine the associations between sweat test outcome in the 18-month periods before and after the site visit for all CF care centers combined and by center for all sweat tests performed and then separately by NICU status. To allow for time for the recommended changes to be implemented, QNS rates were determined for 2 time periods: 6 months after the visit and the subsequent 12 months. The average age at time of sweat test overall and by NICU status were calculated for each center, and t-tests were used to test for significant differences in the 18-month period following the site visit compared to the 18-month period before the visit. An Î± value of .05 was used for this study.
