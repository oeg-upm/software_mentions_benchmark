The specification for Taylor_Sin_P has two additional inequalities, bounding the output value R to allow us to derive tight bounds for R when proving VCs involving calls of this procedure. Verifying this procedure in GNATprove gives one NVC for our proving process, corresponding to the final post-condition. This NVC is referred to as and Taylor_Sin_P in Table 4. The exact NVC is in folder examples/taylor_sine in [3].
