We speculate that KS lesions that express viral lytic proteins, such as the viral thymidine kinase or the viral phosphorylase, mayOutliers are indicated by dots. (C) Pairwise correlations of log 2 mRNA levels (C T ) for the two cellular genes coding for actin (hu. actin) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and two latent viral genes coding for the viral cyclin (orf72f1) and LANA (lat273F), which originate from the same constitutive promoter. Note that higher mRNA levels correspond to lower C T numbers. Shown are scatter plots and a linear regression fit line below the diagonal, distribution of C T s for the individual genes across all samples on the diagonal, and pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients above the diagonal of this panel matrix. be susceptible to treatment with antiviral drugs, but that the majority of lesions in HIV-suppressed individuals are not. Viral RNA profiling. RNA was isolated and analyzed by realtime qPCR for all KSHV mRNAs as previously described (18). All primers have a predicted melting temperature (T m ) of 60 Ϯ 1°C. Real-time qPCR was conducted under universal cycling conditions (40 cycles) with SYBR green dye as the method of detection. The final primer concentration was 250 nM in a total 20.0-l reaction. Total RNA was isolated using triazole (Sigma, Inc.) and subjected to DNase I treatment (Zymed, Inc.). RNA was reverse transcribed using a cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). RNA integrity was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer series C and software (Agilent, Inc.) and qPCR conducted on an Opticon-2 MJR instrument (Bio-Rad Inc.). The instrument error was Յ6%. Control reactions (reverse transcriptase [RT] negative) were uniformly negative. All measurements were conducted in triplicate.
