Operative data on patients who underwent laparoscopic colectomy for colonic polyps was retrieved from a prospectively collected database of all consecutive patients who have undergone an elective laparoscopic colorectal procedure by our surgical team since September 2003. These data were collected in an excel data sheet and include demographic data, preoperative diagnosis (endoscopic and pathology), perioperative parameters, and final pathology results.
