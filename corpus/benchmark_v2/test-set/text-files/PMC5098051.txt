The Shapiro-Wilk test verified normal distributions of the data for exhaustive performance, plasma volume. If assumptions for normality were not met (oral temperature and plasma lactate), data were log-transformed before statistical analysis. The untransformed values are shown in the text, tables and figures. Precooling and non-precooling groups were as between subjects' factor, and time (baseline, mid test and post test) was regarded as within subjects' factor. A mixed repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess the main effects and interaction effect of these factors on the dependent variables. If the significant time effect or group × time interaction effect were observed, then one way repeated measures with Bonferroni as post-hoc and independent samples t test were conducted for further analysis. Independent t test was used to compare the subjects' characteristics and exhaustive performance. Research data were analyzed by SPSS-19. Partial eta-squared was used to assess the effect size and significant level was set P ≤ 0.05.
