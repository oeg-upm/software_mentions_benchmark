Data analysis was performed using the Tint analysis software (Axona, UK). The collected waveforms from the system unit were displayed as clusters by plotting the peak-to-peak amplitude of each spike on one electrode against that on each of the other three. The clusters were isolated initially by hand. Complex spike cells with one or two firing fields were separated on the basis of spike shape, firing rate, and firing location. At least 50 spikes were isolated for each cluster. Once the cluster was isolated, a boundary of cluster was automatically generated by Tint software (Axona, UK). Then the same boundary was applied for cluster cutting in all other trials. After the cluster cutting, firing rate maps for each cell were visualized and smoothed using Tint, which divided the camera view arena into 64 3 64 square bins with a side length of 2.5 cm. The firing rate for a given cell in each bin indicated the spike number divided by dwell time in that bin. The firing rate maps were presented in color with a lowest firing rate (i.e., 0 Hz) in blue and the highest in red. Place field was defined as the contiguous group of pixels possessing a firing rate higher than half of the peak firing rate and covering <60% of the size of the recording arena. If a place cell was identified with one or more place fields, recordings were repeated two to three time on the same day and at least once more on the second day to verify its stability. If no qualified cell activity was identified, the tetrodes were advanced 25-50 mm and rats were returned to their home cages for at least 2 h. The maximum movement of tetrodes per day was 150 mm.
