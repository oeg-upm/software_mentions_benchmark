A review of previous academic and policy-making documents have been conducted. For academic publications, Thomson Scientific's Web of Science, Elsevier's Scopus and Google Scholar have been used as search engines in order to retrieve state-of-the-art literature. For policy-making documents, Eur-lex has been employed, which provides online access to the EU official journal, treaties, legislation in force, preparatory acts, case law, and documents of the European Parliament, Council and Commission.
