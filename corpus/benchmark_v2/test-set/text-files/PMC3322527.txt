The graphical representation of genes (n = 27) displaying the most significant changes in expression patterns in response to TGFβ stimulation with their FC values based on microarray analyses were shown (A). Only TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 treatments were represented in (A) due to their statistically significant p-values detected by dChip. (B,C) Gene expression profiles of all 27 genes were independently validated using qPCR and data was analyzed using REST 2009 (Pfaffl et al., 2002). Expression variation for each gene was visualized in a whisker-box plot. Transcripts were sorted alphabetically.
