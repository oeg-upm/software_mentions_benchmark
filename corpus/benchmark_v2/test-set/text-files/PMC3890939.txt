Through analyses of the time-resolved intensity of the SMS spectra, hyperfine parameters, including hyperfine magnetic fields, containing structural and electronic information of the resonating nucleus can be derived. The high resolution (DE/E , 1*10 27) of the SMS technique enables us to detect the AFM to PM phase transition of SrFe 2 As 2 at high pressures. The spectra were fitted using the CONUSS program 35 to derive hyperfine parameters including hyperfine magnetic fields of the Fe ions.
Angle-dispersive XRD measurements were performed on powder samples at the 16-IDB beamline of the APS, ANL. The powder samples were gently ground from the same batch of the 57 Fe-enriched single crystals used for SMS experiments and loaded into the same symmetric DAC using Ne pressure medium and ruby pressure calibrate. XRD measurements of the starting sample showed consistent lattice parameters to the single crystals. To avoid systematic errors, care was taken to ensure that experimental conditions between SMS and XRD experiments were consistent: the same cryostat with the same temperature thermocouples and membrane controller were used in both experiments. Two types of XRD experiments were conducted: decreasing temperatures at a constant pressure with an x-ray wavelength of 0.4072 Å ; increasing pressures at a constant temperature of 50 K or 13 K with an x-ray wavelength of 0.3737 Å . Diffraction patterns were collected by a MAR345 detector and processed using the FIT2D software. Rietveld refinements of the patterns were performed using the GSAS package 36.
