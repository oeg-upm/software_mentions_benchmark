Dust exposure to rice mill workers was measured with the help of Respicon Particle Sampler {Model: 8522, TSI, USA; Instrument type-two stage, virtual impactor, with three stage gravimetric filter sampler; 50% cut aerodynamic dia.-Inlet: 100 micron, Stage 1: 4 micron, Stage 2: 10 micron, Stage 3: all remaining particles; Filter type-37 mm diameter fiberglass without organic binders or PVC filters with 5.0 micrometer pore size; Sample flow rate-3.11 liters per minute} before and after mechanical intervention. The Respicon Particle Sampler (RPS) has three filters where different sizes of dust are being collected. The dust was measured by two methods: (i) Sampler was mounted in the breathing zone of worker Fig. 1a) and allowed him to perform his work from 4 to 7 hours. The data collected through this method is presents as dust at feeding-cum-sieving section because the same person was moving from feeding to sieving during work.(ii) Sampler was fixed at one place Fig. 1b) and started collecting dust for 4 to 7 hours during the mill operation. The dust concentration was collected at various zones viz feeding, sieving, polishing and packaging via this method. To determine the mass concentration of each of the size fractions, the three Respicon Particle Sampler filters were post-weighed on the same digital micro-balance as was used to pre-weigh the filters. The calculation of dust concentration of each size fraction namely respirable, thoracic, inhalable and total dust was carried out through Data Spread sheet (TSI, USA) using Eqs. 1 to 4.
