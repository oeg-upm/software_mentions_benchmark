Parametric data are presented as mean±SD and nonparametric data as median (inter-quartile range). χ 2 Test was used to compare categorical data and t test or Mann-Whitney test to compare continuous data depending on whether data were parametric or nonparametric. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was calculated based on mortality data censored for admission. Binary logistic regression was used to test significant univariate associations with inhospital mortality. p Values of<0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS V 19.
