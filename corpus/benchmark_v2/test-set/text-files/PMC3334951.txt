Seventy-one samples from 26 DCUs and 36 samples from 15 outlets of the water distribution pipework within the departments (three independent water lines) of the Bernhard Gottlieb University Clinic of Dentistry were included in this evaluation. The DCUs were exclusively supplied with drinking water from the Vienna water supply system. All DCUs are equipped with an integrated disinfection device. The following DCU types are being used in the various departments: Sirona C3 (Sirona Dental Systems, Bensheim, Germany), Kavo 1062C and 1065T, 1066R (KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach/Riß, Germany). The setup of the integrated disinfection system shall be described for the type Sirona C3 as representative example. The system consists of a tank being filled with a disinfectant containing hydrogen peroxide and silver ions -Dentosept P (1.41% H 2 O 2 and 25 ppm silver ions) / Dentosept PL (1.41% H 2 O 2 and 17 ppm silver ions) (Metasys Medizintechnik GmbH, Innsbruck; Austria) and Oxygenal 6 (6% H 2 O 2 ) (KaVo Dental GmbH, Biberach/Riß, Germany) -under control of a level switch. Via a flow limiter with solenoid valve the disinfectant is introduced into the water-filled mixing tank and its fluid is flushed through the lines of the dental unit. Samples of 500 ml (corresponding to the bottle marking) were collected in sterile plastic bottles with screw cap containing sodium thiosulfate (Sterilin ® , Caerphilly, United Kingdom). The samples collected from the DCU were taken prior to taking the DCU in operation, after 2 minutes of waterflow lead time. Sampling was always done in the same sequence, starting from the connection end of the handpiece, the ultrasonic scaler and the orifice of the air/water spray. Samples were collected from 10 DCUs at 4 different time points, from 15 DCUs at 2 different time points and from 1 dental chair at one time point. Water samples from the water distribution pipework within the departments were also collected prior to taking the DCU in operation. Samples were taken from 4 pipes at 4 time points, from 9 pipes at 2 time points, and from 2 pipes at one time point.The water samples were tested for aerobic heterotrophic colony-forming units using the pour plate method with amounts of 1 ml and 1 ml of samples at 1:100 dilution. Two different agar media were applied: initially, a yeast extract agar (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany) at 36°C for 48 h ± 4 h and 22°C for 72 h ± 4 h according to EN ISO 6222 [11], secondly, the R2A agar (Merck, Darmstadt. Germany) at 35°C for 72 h ± 4 h and 120 h ± 4 h as well as at 22°C for 120 h ± 4 h and 168 h ± 4 h according to US-EPA [12]. For the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa a membrane filter method was used. Portions of 100 ml were filtered through filters with a pore size of 0.45 µm and transferred onto Pseudomonas selective agar with supplement (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom) for an incubation time of 48 h ± 4 h at 36°C according to EN ISO 16266 [13]. Testing for Legionella spp. was also done by using a membrane filter method. Portions of 10 and 100 ml were filtered though black filters with a pore size of 0.45 µm, which were transferred onto a GVPC-medium (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Additionally, two portions of 0.5 ml were plated on selective and non-selective Legionella agar. All plates were incubated at 36°C for at least 168 h ± 4 h according to EN ISO 11731-2 [14]. Differentiation of Legionella pneumophila serogroup (Sg) 1, Sg 2-15 and non-pneumophila Legionella was done using test sera (Oxoid, Hampshire, United Kingdom). Isolates of Sg 1 were further subdivided into nine subtypes by application of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) using the "Dresden Panel" [15]. Molecular typing of L. pneumophila was performed using the consensus sequence-based scheme (SBT) described by Gaia et al. [16] and the EWGLI (European Working Group for Legionella Infections) SBT database (version 3.0) [17]. Isolates of non-pneumophila Legionella spp. were identified using a sequence-based classification scheme targeting the mip gene [18]. The data were evaluated in SPSS -Version 16.0 -(SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Apart from frequency calculations (minimum, maximum, median and interquartile range), correlation according to Pearson were tested. For all statistical analyses, p-values <0.05 were considered as significant.
