Linear regression through the origin was used to investigate the estimate of ratio between blood and salivary cotinine. Age and BMI had been found to affect the regression coefficient in identical analysis performed in nonpregnant smokers (Benowitz et al., 2009; Jarvis et al., 2003; Tricker, 2006), whereas gestational age affects nicotine metabolism (Benowitz et al., 2009; Dempsey et al., 2002; Rebagliato et al., 1998). Hence, the effects of these a priori factors on the regression coefficient were investigated by interaction testing. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA, version 11.2. All CIs were at 95% and level of significance was at 5%.
