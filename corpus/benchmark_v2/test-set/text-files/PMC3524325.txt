The results are reported as mean Â± standard deviation (SD) for the quantitative variables and are summarized by absolute frequencies and percentages for the categorical variables. Differences in the distribution of the characteristics in the patients were examined using the chi-square test for the discrete variables, while the t-test was employed to examine differences between the two groups for the continuous variables. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to eliminate the effect of the confounders. For the statistical analyses, the statistical software SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and the statistical package SAS version 9.1 for windows (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) were used.
Additionally, the multivariable linear regression test, SPSS 16, showed a higher range of PaO 2 / FiO 2 at one hour after extubation and PaO 2 / FiO 2 at four hours after extubation in the patients with the new extubation method than that in those with the conventional extubation method (8.888 mmHg and 8.248 mmHg, respectively); there were, however, no significant differences.
Finally, considering the cut point of 225 for PaO 2 / FiO 2 , we found PaO 2 / FiO 2 < 225 in about 51.3% and 37.3% in the conventional and new method groups, respectively, at one hour after extubation and also 54.2% and 32.7% in the control and case groups, respectively, at four hours after extubation; the differences were statistically significant. Therefore, the efficiency of the new method for enhancing PaO 2 / FiO 2 and oxygenation rate was apparent in the level < 225. Regarding the other ABG variables such as pH, BE (base excess), and PaO 2 , their differences were not significant statistically; be that as it may, almost all of them enjoyed improvement in the new method group. Furthermore, with respect to rough parameters, clinical need to perform ABG analysis, and use of reservoir masks or nasal cannulae, there were fewer patients with Po 2 / Fio 2 < 200 and PO 2 / FiO 2 < 300 at one and four hours after extubation in the case group. Although these differences are not statistically significant, they seem to further underscore the efficiency of the new method. At forty-eight hours after extubation, in the conventional method group, 8 patients (of 20), who required ABG, had respiratory parameters within the range of PO 2 / FiO 2 < 150, while none of the new method group patients needed ABGforty-eight hours after extubation. Given the high rate of mortality and morbidity in such patients, these percentages should be regarded as a very important clinical parameter to compare the two groups and to introduce the new method as an effective and safe extubation method. Considering confounding variables in the logistic regression test using SAS 9.1 software, we found that in almost all the time periods, PaO 2 / FiO 2 was higher in the new extubation method group; however, only PaO 2 / FiO 2 four hours after extubation < 225 between the two groups was statistically significant (Table 6).
