A cross-sectional study was conducted with foundry workers within the metallurgical industry (Metal Casting Process, Shell Molding Line; with shape-out tasks) in Sao Paulo, Brazil. All participants signed informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (protocol 0048.1.1186.000-10). All workers who performed their duties while exposed to high temperatures from ovens were selected to this study. Workers were excluded due to various reasons such as dismissal, sick leave, or refusal to participate. All participants performed spirometry (EasyOne TM, model 2001) according to the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society protocol (2005) at their workplace. The values are expressed as a percentage of the predicted values obtained in Brazilian subjects 15). The measurement of peak expiratory flow was performed following three rapid exhalations by the patient (Mini Wright Standard with a flow between 60 and 800 l/min). The best result among them was used. Anthropometrics measure (height and weight) of the participants were performed using the Microlife brand, previously calibrated stadiometer (Sany). To evaluate the activity level of the workers, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form was used. The questions are related to the time spent engaging in physical activity in a typical week/habitual. People were considered active if they had accumulated more than 150 minutes of moderate or vigorous physical activity per week 16). Then, a routine physical examination and evaluation of previous medical history; respiratory signs and symptoms, according to a respiratory disease's questionnaire; smoking history; and checklist were implemented. The dyspnea was assessed by Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnea scale 17). The foundry workers were classified according to exposure time in High (>5 years) and Low exposure groups (≤ 5 years). A control group consisted of administrative area workers from the same industry. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was used to analyze the data distribution. The data were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis, mean, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni adjusted was used to determine whether there are significant differences between groups (α<5%). The statistical analysis was performed using the Sigma Stat software package, version 3.2 (San Jose, EUA).
