The parameters pH, COD, and volatile suspended solidssequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogeny were as described previously (30, 43, 36). Partial sequences generated were assembled using BioEdit v5.0.1 (19) Nucleotide ambiguities were omitted and evolutionary distances calculated by using the Jukes and Cantor option (23) in TreeCon (41). Phylogenetic trees were constructed from evolutionary distances using the Neighbour-Joining method (32). Tree topology was re-examined by bootstrap method (1000) of re-sampling (14).transformed using the log 10 function in order to reduce the variation coefficient and to apply parametric statistics.
