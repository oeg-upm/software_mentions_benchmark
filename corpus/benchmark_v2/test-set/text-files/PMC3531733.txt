Extraction and Biochemical Characterization of LipoglycansLipoglycans were extracted from delipidated cells as described previously (31, 32) and treated with H 2 O 2 before immunological assays to remove any endotoxin contamination (13) and to yield a negative Limulus amebocyte lysate test using E-TOXA-TE TM (Sigma-Aldrich). For MALDI-TOF-MS, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid was used as a matrix, and samples (0.5 l; 10 g/l) were analyzed on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) using linear mode detection. Furthermore, lipoglycans were derivatized for glycosyl and linkage analysis as described previously (31). All of the data were collected and analyzed using Xcaliber (version 1.2).
Flow Cytometry Analysis-Cell surface markers were analyzed using specific antibodies against Ly6G (APC, 1A8; BioLegend), GR1 (PercP-Cy5.5, RB6 -8C5; BioLegend), and CD11b (phycoerythrin, M1/70; eBioscience) for identification of neutrophils or against CD4 (eFluor450, RM4 -5; eBioscience) for identification of CD4 ϩ T cells. For intracellular detection of cytokines, specific antibodies for IL-17 (phycoerythrin, eBio17B7; eBioscience) and IFN-␥ (FITC, XMG1.2; eBioscience) or isotype control antibodies (BioLegend) were used. Fluorescence was analyzed using an LSRII flow cytometer and FACSDiva Software (BD Bioscience) and data with FlowJo software (TreeStar).
