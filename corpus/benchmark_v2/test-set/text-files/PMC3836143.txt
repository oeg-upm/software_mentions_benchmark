A fasting blood sample was collected at weeks 0, 4, and 16. All samples were processed and stored at 2808C within 2 h of collection. All laboratory analyses were blinded. Plasma ascorbic acid concentrations were determined according to the method described by Vuilleumier and Keck (20). Serum concentrations of lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin, a-carotene, b-carotene, and lycopene were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection, as described by Craft et al. (21). Assays were standardized against appropriate National Institute of Standards and Technology control materials. The fasting serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides) was assessed using enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche Diagnostics Limited, West Sussex, U.K.) on the ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory, Warrington, U.K.). LDL cholesterol was calculated using a standard Friedewald equation (22). Plasma adiponectin (total, high-molecular weight, medium-molecular weight, and lowmolecular weight) were measured by ELISA (ALPCO diagnostics); low-molecular weight adiponectin was obtained by subtracting the combined concentration of medium-molecular weight and highmolecular weight adiponectin (measured directly) from the total adiponectin concentration. Serum insulin levels were measured by ELISA (Abbot IMx; Abbott Laboratories, Berkshire, U.K.). Plasma glucose levels were measured using an automated glucose oxidase method using a Beckman Glucose Analyzer 2. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were used to calculate the HOMA score (23). Commercial kits were used to measure C-peptide (Dako UK Ltd, Ely, U.K.) and nonesterified fatty acids (Wako Chemicals GmbH, Neuss, Germany) on the ILab-600 biochemical analyzer (Instrumentation Laboratory).
All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Normally distributed continuous variables were summarized using the mean and SD. Skewed variables were log-transformed for parametric analysis and summarized using the geometric mean and interquartile range. A one-way ANOVA test, or x 2 test, was used to compare the three groups at baseline for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. One-way ANOVA with linear trend test was used to examine differences in mean change (i.e., preintervention value minus postintervention value for a given continuous variable) between groups for the primary and secondary end points. Post hoc analyses were performed using the Dunnett test comparing the control group (one to two portions) with the intervention groups (four and seven portions). For each variable, intervention analysis was performed for all participants who had completed the study protocol according to randomization group. The test for linear trend (with changes in variable and portion allocation as the dependent and independent variables, respectively), analogous to linear regression, was incorporated in order to take account of the dose-response design. Variables that were not normally distributed were log-transformed prior to these analyses. A sample size of 30 patients per group gave the study 80% power to detect a 10% difference in GIR between groups at a 5% level of significance (15,16).
