Predefined interactions (sex9preexisting chronic kidney disease [pre-CKD], pre-CKD9uNGAL, and pre-CKD9uAGT) between predictors and potential nonlinear association of included biomarkers were also examined at the 5% significance level. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of the 2 incomplete measures by leaving the corresponding 2 cases out. All analyses were done with SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, version 9.4). A 2-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
