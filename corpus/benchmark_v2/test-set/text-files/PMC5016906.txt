The locations of radiographic fi ndings were recorded according to the 3 acetabular zones described by Charnley and to the 7 femoral zones described by Gruen. Osteolysis was defi ned as a non-linear lucency of 3 mm or more around the prosthesis (Claus et al. 2003). Loosening of an acetabular component was determined from evidence of migration and a radiolucent line (Hodgkinson et al. 1988, Johnston et al. 1990). An acetabular component was diagnosed as "loose" when it had migrated more than 4 mm in either the horizontal or the vertical direction, or if it had tilted by more than 5°. Cemented acetabular components that had continuous radiolucent lines with any thickness in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Uncemented acetabular components that had radiolucent lines wider than 2 mm in all 3 zones were categorized as being loose. Loosening of an uncemented stem was defi ned by whether the stem was considered to be unstable according to the criteria of Engh et al. (1990). Loosening of a cemented stem was defi ned by whether we found a continuous radiolucent line around the stem, or stem subsidence of > 5 mm. Bone defects were assessed using Paprosky's classifi cations (Paprosky et al. 1994, Della Valle and Paprosky 2004). Bone areas with reduced density in the acetabulum and proximal femur were recorded as "atrophy" (Wangen et al. 2008). Thinning of the femoral cortex adjacent to a well-fi xed stem was recorded as "cortical atrophy" (Figure 2). Heterotopic ossifi cation was defi ned using the classifi cation of Brooker et al. (1973). In 3 hips, the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, so we evaluated the acetabular component only. In 1 hip, all the implants had been removed, so we assessed bone defects only. Leg-length discrepancy (LLD) was assessed by comparing the heights of greater or lesser trochanters relative to the line connecting the teardrops of the acetabulum. If the deformity was severe or if the proximal femur was replaced with a tumor prosthesis, we did not evaluate the patient's LLD. For analysis radiographs, we used Mdesk Orthopaedics software (RSA Biomedical, Umeå, Sweden).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine the survival after the primary THR and the fi rst revision surgery. We performed time-trend analyses to assess changes in the revision rate between the periods 1987-1995 and 1996-2010. All calculations were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics.
