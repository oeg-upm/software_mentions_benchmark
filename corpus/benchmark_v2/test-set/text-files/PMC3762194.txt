Sequences of ENC homologs were retrieved from the Ensembl genome database and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Protein database, by performing BlastP searches (Altschul et al. 1997) using human ENC1 as query. An optimal multiple alignment of the retrieved ENC amino acid sequences including the query sequence was constructed fig. 1B) using the alignment editor XCED in which the MAFFT program is implemented (Katoh et al. 2005). Similarly, a second alignment including human, zebrafish, Drosophila
The diagnostic amino acid residues, namely a diglycine followed by a tyrosine, six nonconserved amino acids, and a tryptophan residue are highlighted with gray background. This pattern is disrupted in the first kelch repeat of all three cyclostome proteins where the first glycine ("G") is replaced by an alanine residue ("A"). Another nonconserved site is a phenylalanine ("F") instead of a tyrosine ("Y") in the fourth kelch repeat of the chicken ENC3 protein. Because of similar physiochemical properties, these substitutions do not necessarily prevent the characteristic folding of the mature protein and thus its cellular function. Interestingly, the first kelch repeat of all vertebrate ENC proteins lacks the tryptophan residue and thus does not show the described motif. (B) A phylogenetic tree of the three ENC subgroups of jawed vertebrates, three cyclostome homologs, and the Branchiostoma floridae gene "XP_002612442" as outgroup is shown. Support values are shown for each node in order, bootstrap probabilities in the ML tree inference, and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Analysis is based on 311 amino acids, and the JTT + I + F + À 4 model was assumed (shape parameter of gamma distribution a ¼ 0.66). Red arrows denote sequences that are newly reported in this study. For accession IDs of amino acid sequences used in this analysis, see supplementarySea lamprey P. marinus ENC-A was predicted in the AUGUSTUS web server (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/ webaugustus/prediction/create, last accessed July 24, 2013) with its species-specific parameters on the supercontig22564 in the version 3 assembly of the genome sequencing project (PMAR3.0). An ORF of the gene designated P. marinus ENC-A was curated (for sequence see supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). A truncated fragment of this gene is also present in Ensembl release 64 (ENSPMAG00000008371). The second lamprey ENC gene (ENC-B) is available in Ensembl version 64 (ENSPMAG00000000574). Because of unresolved orthology of these lamprey ENC genes to gnathostome ENC1-3, we refer to them as PmENC-A and PmENC-B.
In phylogenetic analyses, we employed PhyML 3.0 (Guindon et al. 2010) for maximum-likelihood (ML) tree inference and (Stamatakis 2006), because this software tends to outperform PhyML under these conditions (Guindon et al. 2010). Optimal amino acid substitution models were determined by ProtTest (Abascal et al. 2005). To identify invertebrate orthologs of ENC genes and to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the ENC gene family, a data set that contained relevant representatives of each major vertebrate class for each ENC subtype was createdIn Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry
The aforementioned 5 0 -and 3 0 -cDNA fragments of S. canicula ENC1 were used as templates for riboprobes used in in situ hybridizations. Paraffin-embedded section in situ hybridizations using S. canicula embryos were performed as described previously (Kuraku et al. 2005), with the modification that the acetylation step and the proteinase K treatment were skipped. Whole-mount in situ hybridizations on catshark embryos were performed according to a protocol originally developed for snake and lizard embryos (Di-PoE N, personal communication). Zebrafish standard whole-mount in situ hybridizations and double in situ hybridizations using the enc1 riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin-UTP and the egr2b riboprobes labeled with Fluorescein (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) were performed as described previously (Begemann et al. 2001; Manousaki et al. 2011). In double in situ staining, enc1 transcripts were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/ 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP) and egrb2 transcripts by a p-Iodonitrotetrazolium/BCIP-based detection. Stained embryos were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Immunohistochemistry on whole-mount S. canicula embryos was performed as described previously (Kuratani and Eichele 1993) with minor modifications. Monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (Sigma T7451) was used to detect developing axons. As secondary antibody, AlexaFluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L, Invitrogen A-11004) was applied, and the signal was detected using fluorescence microscopy (Leica). Images were processed with Zeiss Axiovision andAdobe Photoshop software.
To analyze the mode of the putative loss of ENC3 in eutherians, we downloaded a list of Ensembl IDs of 79 genes harbored in the 1-Mb genomic region flanking ENC3 in chicken, together with IDs of human orthologs of those genes via theBioMart interface. Human orthologs on chromosome 19 were plotted against the corresponding chicken chromosomal region fig. 3).
