All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows ver. 19.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA). We used the mean value of both eyes for all parameters. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare parameters between the two groups. The Spearman rank-order correlation test was used to evaluate the relationships between variables in the patients with Sjögren dry eye disease. A p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in all analyses. Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the 155 study participants. Their mean age was 52.7 ± 12.0 years, and 148 (95.5%) were female. Table 1 summarizes the mean (±stan-dard deviation) values for the ocular surface parameters, i.e., OSDI score, tear film break-up time, Schirmer I test, tear osmolarity, and OSS. In the Sjögren dry eye group (n = 39), mean tear osmolarity in SS was 311.1 ± 16.4 mOsm/ L, and 16 measurements (41.0%) were over 316 mOsm/L. Mean tear film break-up time was 3.0 ± 2.1 seconds, and 35 measures (89.7%) were ≤5 mm. The mean Schirmer I test value was 5.4 ± 6.9, and 24 measures (61.5%) were ≤5 mm, indicating significant dry eye. In the non-Sjögren dry eye group (n = 116), mean tear osmolarity was 297.7 ± 12.7 mOsm/L, and 11 measures (9.5%) were over 316 mOsm/L. Mean tear film break-up time was 4.6 ± 1.9 seconds, and 76 measures (65.5%) were ≤5 mm. The mean Schirmer Itest value was 6.7 ± 6.5, and 61 measures (52.6%) were ≤5 mm. Tear osmolarity value and OSS were higher in the Sjögren dry eye group. In contrast, the tear film break-up time value was higher in the non-Sjögren dry eye group. The scatter plots in Fig. 1 show correlations between tear osmolarity and other ocular surface parameters in the Sjögren dry eye group. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between mean tear osmolarity and OSDI score (ρ = 0.405, p = 0.011) and OSS (ρ = 0.592, p < 0.001). There was also a statistically significant negative correlation between mean tear osmolarity and the Schirmer I test (ρ = -0.625, p < 0.001). However, there was no significant correlation between mean tear osmolarity and tear film break-up time (ρ = 0.110, p = 0.505).
