Sequences were edited with the DNASTAR software, v5.0.5 (DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA). Alignment of the sequences was performed using CLUSTAL_X (Thompson et al. 1997). Phylogenetic trees were obtained from the data using Bayesian modelling (MCMC). MCMC analysis was performed using MrBayes, v3.0b4 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). This program performs a Bayesian inference of the phylogeny, using Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses (Geyer 1991). For a given dataset, the general time reversible (GTR) model was employed with gamma-distributed substitution rates. Markov chains were run for 10 6 generations, saving aNotes -Marasmius aurantioferrugineus is a very distinct species characterised by a large, orange-ferrugineous pileus, a rather long and wide stipe, large clavate, fusoid to sublacrimoid basidiospores, and the absence of pleurocystidia.
