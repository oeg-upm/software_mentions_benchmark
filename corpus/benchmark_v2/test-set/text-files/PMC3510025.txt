The quantitation was conducted with Applied Biosystems 7300 Real-Time PCR System by using SYBR Green I Dye (Life Technologies).
For live imaging, cells were cultured on 35-mm glass base dishes and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO 2 during observation. For stimulation of RhoD(wt)-transfected 10T1/2 cells with FGFs, the cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM before addition of FGFs. The cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml FGF2, FGF4, or FGF8 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) premixed with 15 μg/ml heparin sodium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). For analysis of the protrusions extending toward FGF-coated beads, >100-μm-diameter heparin-acrylic beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were sorted out with Cell Strainer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The beads were soaked in 100 ng/ml FGF and washed once with PBS. They were placed in the culture of RhoD(wt)-transfected and serum-starved 10T1/2 cells. These cells were observed with either the Olympus confocal laserscanning microscope FV-1000D or a Carl Zeiss inverted microscope Axiovert 200 equipped with a CoolSNAP cf charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) operated with Openlab software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Time-lapse images were processed with ImageJ software.
