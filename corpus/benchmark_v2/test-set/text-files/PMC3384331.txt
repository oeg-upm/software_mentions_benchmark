The obtained viral genomic DNA was amplified using a GenomePhi kit (GE Healthcare) and used to make barcoded (10 bp) fragment libraries for 454 sequencing on a Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium (Roche/454 Life Science). The reads were assembled using the gsAssembler (Roche/454 Life Science). The coverage of the different genomes was 17Â for HRPV-2, 14Â for HRPV-3, 300Â for HRPV-6 and 300Â for HGPV-1. The obtained assembly was verified with PCR products that for HRPV-2, HRPV-3 and HGPV-1 covered the whole genome. The final genome sequences were obtained by sequencing these PCR products. For HRPV-6, several Sanger sequencing runs confirmed the initial assembly. The primers used for PCR and sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S2. For the verification of the discontinuous regions, genomic DNA was used in sequencing reactions with primers, which are also listed in Supplementary Table S2. All sequencing reactions were carried out by using BigDye Termination Chemistry v. 3.1 and analysed on an ABI 3130 (Applied Biosystems). Sequencing reactions were purified with CleanSeq (Agencourt) using a Beckman NX p robot (Beckman Coulter). Sequences were assembled and edited using GAP4. The sequences were submitted to GenBank and can be found under the accession numbers JN882264 (HRPV-2), JN882265 (HRPV-3), JN882266 (HRPV-6) and JN882267 (HGPV-1).
The genome sequences were annotated using DNAMaster (http://cobamide2.bio.pitt.edu, version 5.22.2), pDRAW32 and GeneMark.hmm for Prokaryotes (version 2.8). Homologous nucleotide and protein sequences were searched for using BLASTN and BLASTP tools, respectively, (28) available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Manually refined annotations were based on GeneMark.hmm coding potential analysis, the obtained protein chemistry data and colinearity with previously annotated pleomorphic virus genomes (6,20). The properties of identified proteins and the products of putative ORFs were analysed using expert protein analysis system (EXPASY) proteomics tools. Isoelectric points and molecular masses were determined using Compute pI/MW tool (29). The signal sequences for VP4-like proteins were predicted using Signal P (version3.0) (30) and TatFind Servers (31). Conserved protein signature sequences were determined using InterProScan (32). Putative trans-membrane regions of proteins were additionally determined using combined predictions by TMHMM tool (33) and TMPred tool (34). Coiled-coil regions were predicted using Coil tool (35). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using T-Coffee (36), Muscle (37) and Praline (38). Conserved DNA motifs in aligned nucleotide sequences (T-Coffee) were visualized with WebLogo (39).
Pairwise identity percentages between amino acid sequences of identified or putative proteins were determined using EMBOSS Needle tool at EMBL-EBI. Protein sequences were aligned with T-Coffee program, and conserved blocks for the phylogenetic analysis were selected using Gblocks (40). The phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihood method using phyml algorithm (41). Resulting trees were visualized inPhylodendron (http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/ java/apps/trees/).
The first protein encoded by a conserved cluster of genes is VP3-like protein (Figure 1). It is a major structural protein of haloarchaeal pleomorphic viruses, predicted to contain several transmembrane regions. VP3-like proteins of the first subgroup of viruses and putative proviruses share extensive identity at the amino acid level ($50% and above, Supplementary Figure S3). In contrast, VP3-like proteins of the second subgroup show only $20% identity to each other and to homologues of the first subgroup members. The next protein encoded in the conserved cluster of genes is VP4-like major structural protein (Figure 1), forming the spike structure on the virion surface. This protein is processed during maturation. In order to predict the translation start site, the empirically determined N-termini (Table 1) together with Signal P andTat find programs were used. Three of the manually annotated VP4-like protein precursors were predicted to have a twin-arginine signal sequence suggesting export of the protein in a folded state. Most of the VP4-like protein precursors share only $20% identity (Supplementary Table S 8). Even though VP4-like polypeptides are much more diverse than VP3-like proteins, the secondary structures are predicted to be similar. All of them are also predicted to contain a coiled-coil region in the C-terminus of the protein just preceding the transmembrane domain that serves as a membrane anchor.
