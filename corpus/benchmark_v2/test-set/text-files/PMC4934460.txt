Time-horizon A 120-month (10-year) time-horizon was chosen in order to mitigate inherent uncertainty in the extrapolation of 34-month OS data over a lifetime-horizon. The 10-year time-horizon was deemed both sufficient to capture meaningful differences in OS and appropriate from an economic perspective since, according to published data, only 10% of patients with RR-DCT survive at 10 years. 1 The restricted mean, truncated at the 10-year time-horizon, was used to facilitate estimates of OS before and after the empirical data cutoff (at 34 months), while the extended mean was used to estimate CIs around the marginal OS difference. The uncertainty around the estimates was measured using the bootstrap method 15 to evaluate the CIs. All statistical analyses were performed in STATA Version13 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
