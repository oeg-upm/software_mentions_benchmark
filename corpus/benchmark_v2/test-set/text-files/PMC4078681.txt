An iterative process combining human coding and machine learning was used to classify all collected tweets as either organic or commercial. DiscoverText, a cloud-based text analytics software, was used to collect, archive and machine-classify tweets.DiscoverText requires no text preprocessing prior to coding. This is the first study to apply this novel methodology to analysing content related to e-cigarettes. Organic tweets were those deemed non-sponsored; they reflected individual opinions or experiences or linked to non-promotional content. Commercial tweets were defined by presence of any of the following: branded promotional messages; URLs linking to commercial websites; usernames indicating affiliations with commercial sites; or user's Twitter page consisting only of promotional tweets (ie, spammer accounts). For the purposes of this study, a tweet containing a commercial link was coded as 'commercial' regardless of whether it was posted by an ostensibly individual account. Thus our definition of 'commercial' would include many tweets posted by 'affiliate marketers.' Commercial websites included those that directly sold e-cigarette related products as well as 'landing' or 'affiliate' websites for sales 13 ; these sites did not themselves sell e-cigarette related products but promoted or reviewed these products and linked to retailer sites.
