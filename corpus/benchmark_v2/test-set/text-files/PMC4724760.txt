Behavioral economic principles have been used by other industries for decades. The most notable example is the 401(k) retirement plans from companies. Historically, companies offered employees the choice of enrolling in a 401(k) plan. By incorporating active choice, a strategy that requires individuals to select between options, companies experienced a 28% increase in 401(k) participation over the standard opt in procedure. Applying loss aversion through enhanced active choice (e.g. "I don't want to enroll in a 401(k) plan and don't want to take advantage of the employer match") has been shown to induce more compliance. 57,58 The federal Administration of Children and Families (ACF) used a series of interventions to encourage Texas prison inmates to lower the amount of child support they owe while they are in prison. The primary driver is that state welfare agencies are at risk of losing federal funding for late and unpaid child support payments. The interventions included sending a teaser postcard before the official letter arrived, printing materials on blue paper to distinguish it from other mail,explaining other parents had successfully reduced their child support, and sending a reminder postcard for those that did not respond. While fewer than 50% of eligible inmates participated, a social science researcher at ACF explains this was a big impact at a low cost. 59 More recently, researchers have partnered with employers, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers to develop (or investigate) the use of behavioral economics in the health care industry. Interventions have ranged from simple nudges such as promoting seat belt use or encouraging more healthy eating choices by putting the salad bar at the front of a buffet to increasing organ donation and providing financial incentives and peer mentoring to improve medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions. While many interventions target the patient, some target physicians. For example, a radiologist spent more time with a patient's report and felt more connected to the patient when the patient's picture was attached to an X-ray. Patients were 24 times more likely to have a sigmoidoscopy and 9 times more likely to have a fecal occult blood test relative to a control group when physicians suggested screening for colon cancer. 48 These types of nudges are geared toward individuals making one-time decisions (e.g. organ donation). If the goal is to improve medication adherence (a behavior that occurs frequently), then the intervention should occur just as frequently. Behavioral economists believe automated hovering is one way to do this. 55 Automated hovering has been described as a cost-effective way to monitor and provide feedback to patients. Examples include NudgerSize TM (an iPhone application that sends daily exercise reminders to users), electronic pill bottles, glucometers and other devices that transmit information from the patient to the provider. 55 Automatic entry into a daily lottery for taking pills is another example. While there are advantages to using automated hovering (e.g. less resource intensive option for daily engagement), it is not for everyone. Asch et al. 60 explain that cell phones and automatic pill bottle reminders are not ideal for someone frequently hospitalized who likely requires a more personnel-intensive approach. In a RCT using electronic pill bottles to improve warfarin adherence, only patients with baseline international normalized ratio (INR) below the therapeutic range showed significant improvements in anticoagulation, indicating that the intervention worked for only a subset of the population. 51 Studies using financial incentives to influence a behavioral response varied in their effectiveness. Of those with evidence of effectiveness, many included some form of interaction with health care professionals or peers, and most behaviors reverted back to baseline once the intervention stops. Similarly, offering co-payment reductions through value-based insurance design or linking premiums to healthy behaviors has only had modest impacts. 55 In a 2009 systematic review, adult RTRs, when offered free IST, were 95% adherent 6 months post-transplant yet only 48% adherent at 12 months with many becoming non-adherent by the 10th month. The conclusion was that cost does not appear to influence adherence. 16 Volpp et al. 61 explain the effectiveness of the incentive depends on how they are framed, timed, and distributed, and should ideally be small and combined with frequent positive feedback and rewards.
