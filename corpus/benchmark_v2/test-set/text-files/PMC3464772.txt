Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well in 100 ml RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands). After 24 h, serial dilutions of lapatinib (GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK), doxorubicin (Pharmachemie B.V., Haarlem, The Netherlands), 5-fluorouracil (EBEWE Pharma, Unterach, Austria), methotrexate (Emthexate PF, Pharmachemie B.V.), ifosfamide (Holoxan, Baxter B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands), or paclitaxel (Paclitaxel, EBEWE Pharma) were added. All drugs were tested in combination with 17 b-oestradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (SigmaAldrich Chemie, Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) or ICI182,780 (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK). To assay the effects of oestrogen, cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per well in 100 ml RPMI 1640 without phenol red, supplemented with 6% heatinactivated bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA). Twentyfour hours after seeding, 100 ml of medium containing 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mM lapatinib and increasing concentrations of oestradiol were added. WST-1 proliferation assays (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, The Netherlands) were performed on ZR-75-1-or MCF7-derived cell lines after 5 or 6 days, respectively. IC 50 values were estimated by sigmoid inhibitory effect models 107 and 108 as implemented in the software programme Phoenix WinNonLin 6.1 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA, USA).
