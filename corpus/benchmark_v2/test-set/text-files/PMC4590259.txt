After the completeness and consistency of the quantitative data were checked on the printed form of the questionnaire, it was cleaned, coded and entered into EpiData version 3.02. The data analysis was performed by using SPSS version 16.0 statistical package for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to show the prevalence of colostrum avoidance practices, reason for discarding colostrum and the mother's awareness on the advantages of colostrum. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify the factors associated with colostrum avoidance. Variables found statistically significant at p-value <0.25 [15] during binary logistic regression analysis were included in the multivariable logistic regression model. Both crude and adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were reported with 95% confidence interval (CI). Variables at pvalue <0.05 in the final multivariable model were concluded as factors associated with colostrum avoidance.
