where there are a total of n Gaussian functions (that is, transitions), i, each with an area of a i (cm À 1 s À 1 ) and centroid frequency n i (s À 1 ). dR is the relative s.d. of the nanocrystal radius and n g (s À 1 ) is the bandgap frequency of the bulk material. Best fits of a i , n i and dR were calculated using the least squares method. Initial guesses for n i values were determined from the minima of the 2nd derivative of the spectrum or maxima of the 4th derivative of the spectrum (see detailed description in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs 15-21). Values of a i and dR were unbounded, but n i was typically bound to ±50 meV of the initial guess. All calculations were performed using an automated Matlab script. The values of a i were converted to absolute oscillator strengths (f 1 ) with the following formula 54 :
