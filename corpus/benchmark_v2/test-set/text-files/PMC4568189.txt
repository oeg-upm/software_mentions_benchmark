All patients underwent catheterization using standard Judkins or Sones techniques. Angiographic scoring was performed by 2 cardiologists. Coronary angiographies were interpreted visually and were always analyzed in 2 orthogonal views. Stenosis of > 50% in any of the main epicardial vessels reflected a significant coronary artery disease. CABG was performed according to the guidelines of American College of Cardiology. 13 Sample size was determined after a power analysis (power = 0.8, β = 0.2, α = 0.02); using the power analysis and sample size software: PASS 2005 (NCSS Statistical Software, Utah, USA). The clinical criterion for sample size determination was the observed frequency of "per hour urinary output needing medical intervention;" so, we required 35 patients in each group; equals a total of 105; however, to compensate for possible dropouts, we added 20% to the calculated sample size to have a final sample of 126 (42 in each group).
The statistical package SPSS software for Windows (version 16, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), was used for analysis. Quantitative variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Qualitative variables were presented as number and percentage. Paired sample ttest was employed for the comparison of the preoperative and post-operative variables in each group. T-test and ANOVA were used for the comparison of the studied variables between groups.
