Two independent observers trained in radiographic assessment and blinded to the smart tool measurements performed the leg length calculations from the AP radiographs. Each observer was a trained orthopaedic surgeon with experience performing total hip arthroplasty using the posterolateral approach. Changes in leg length were calculated using the perpendicular distance between the inter-teardrop line and the most prominent aspect of the ipsilateral lessertrochanter [32]. The difference between the pre-operative and post-operative leg length for each patient was calculated by each observer and then averaged to provide the final leg length change. An established software program (MATLAB, Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used to select radiographic landmarks and scale images. Pre and postoperative radiographs were corrected for abduction in order to minimize the artifact.
