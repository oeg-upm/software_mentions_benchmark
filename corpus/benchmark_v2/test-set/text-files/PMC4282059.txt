Risk of bias was assessed using one of two approaches, depending on study design. For RCTs, the seven-category Review Manager risk of bias tool was used (RevMan version 5.2; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK), with risk assessed as either high, unclear or low according to criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 31 . For non-RCTs, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) 32 was used, in accordance with previously published methodology 33. Briefly, the NOS allots a maximum of nine points based on the representativeness of the intervention and control groups, ascertainment of intervention, absence of outcomes at study start, comparability of groups based on study design and analysis, blinded assessment/record linkage to confirm outcomes, sufficient length of follow-up and sufficiently low withdrawal rate.
Forest plot generation and statistical analyses were performed using RevMan version 5.2. P < 0â‹…050 was considered to be statistically significant. The RevMan program reports P values to one or two significant digits; where requested, a standard normal (Z) table was consulted to report P values to three decimal places 37. For each endpoint analysed, statistical heterogeneity was examined using the I 2 statistic, which provides an estimate of the percentage of variation across studies arising from study heterogeneity rather than chance 38. When substantial heterogeneity (I 2 greater than 60 per cent) was detected for an endpoint showing a statistically significant effect of high-versus low-chloride fluids, this heterogeneity was further investigated using a random-effects analysis model or subgroup analysis, as appropriate. When visual inspection of a forest plot suggested that the overall effect was driven by a single study (weight greater than 50 per cent), sensitivity analysis excluding this study was performed 39.
