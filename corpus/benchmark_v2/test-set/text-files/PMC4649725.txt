At least eight capillary BG tests, using the BG meter built into the reader, were required to be performed on each day of the sensor wear, both at home and in the clinic. One strip lot was used to minimize lot-to-lot variation. The preferred testing was upon waking, before each meal, an hour after each meal, and at bedtime. Immediately after each BG test, participants obtained a confirmation of a successful sensor scan. Sensor readings were masked to participants, who were asked to maintain their established diabetes management plan. There was no manipulation of the glucose levels of the subjects except for their normal meal and insulin doses. Capillary BG tests coincided with venous YSI samples drawn during in-clinic visits. A linear mixed model was used to assess sensitivity and mean absolute relative difference (MARD) between insertion sites, with subject as a random effect and insertion site (left arm, right arm) and lot as fixed effects. The lag between the System sensor and YSI reference was evaluated using a model that characterizes delay with a time constant. 14 Analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
