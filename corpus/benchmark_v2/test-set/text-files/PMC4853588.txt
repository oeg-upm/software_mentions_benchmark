Background While electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been found to ameliorate migraine-like symptoms, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggests that the brainstem descending pain modulatory system, comprising the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC), may be involved in migraine pathophysiology. We hypothesised that EA would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms via modulation of this descending system. Methods We used a conscious rat model of migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura. Forty male SpragueDawley rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: an EA group, which received EA at GB20 following dural stimulation; a sham acupuncture (SA) group, which received manual acupuncture at a non-acupuncture point following dural stimulation; a Model group, which received dural stimulation but no acupuncture; and a Control group, which received neither dural stimulation nor acupuncture (electrode implantation only).HomeCageScan was used to measure effects on behaviour, and immunofluorescence staining was used to examine neural activation (c-Fos immunoreactivity) in the PAG, RMg, and TNC. Results Compared to the Model group, rats in the EA group showed a significant increase in exploratory, locomotor and eating/drinking behaviour ( p<0.01) and a significant decrease in freezing-like resting and grooming behaviour ( p<0.05). There was a significant increase in the mean number of c-Fos neurons in the PAG, RMg, and TNC in Model versus Control groups ( p<0.001); however, this was significantly attenuated by EA treatment ( p<0.001). There were no significant differences between the SA
We hypothesised that acupuncture pretreatment would ameliorate migraine-like symptoms in recurrent migraine via modulation of the brainstem descending pain modulatory system: the periaqueductal grey (PAG), raphe magnus nucleus (RMg), and trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). To test this hypothesis we chose a rat model of recurrent migraine induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dura surrounding the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), which is an established paradigm of migraine-associated pain. 11 12 The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of EA on behaviour (using HomeCageScan technology) and neuronal activation in the PAG, RMg, and TNC (by immunofluorescence staining).
Spontaneous behaviour was monitored by the automated behavioural acquisition and analysis software 'HomeCageScan' (Clever Systems Inc, Reston, Virginia, USA). Before real/sham electrical dural stimulation, rats were acclimatised for 20 min in an individual transparent acrylic observation cage with an automatic real-time video surveillance and image analysis system, which was lit to model daytime conditions. Subsequently, animals received electrical dural stimulation for 15 min in another cage before being individually placed back into the observation cage for a 1 h recording.
After the last HomeCageScan recording session, animals were anaesthetised with 10% chloral hydrate (15 ml/kg, intraperitoneally) and transcardially perfused through the ascending aorta with 100 ml 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by 500 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were removed and postfixed overnight at 4°C in 4% PFA/ PBS, then transferred to 30% sucrose/PBS for 72 h for cryopreservation. Coronal sections (25 mm thick) through the PAG, RMg, and TNC were cut using a cryostat (Leica CM3050S, Leica Inc, Wetzlar, Germany), incubated with rabbit anti-c-Fos antiserum (sc-52, 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, USA) overnight at 4°C, and then treated with Cy3 goat antirabbit secondary antibodies (111-165-003, 1:500, Jackson
Section images were captured using a Leica semiautomatic light microscope (Leica DM5500 B), and cells were counted in squares at 20× magnification.

One week after surgery to implant electrodes, rats received electrical dural stimulation (or no stimulation in the case of the Control group) every 2 days from day 1 to day 5 (on days 1, 3, and 5). Electroacupuncture (or sham acupuncture) pretreatment was performed daily from day 0 to day 5 (on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) in subgroups of rats. Behavioural analysis was carried out using HomeCageScan immediately after dural stimulation on days 1, 3, and 5. c-Fos immunofluorescence was measured in brain tissues prepared following necropsy on day 5.
The rat model of migraine used herein was developed to mimic clinical pain conditions experienced by migraineurs, based upon clinical diagnostic criteria from the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-II and ICHD-IIIβ classification including a decrease in physical activity during migraine attacks. 3 20 Analysis of behavioural changes using HomeCageScan offers a new way to study migraine. 18 However, it should be remembered that there are clear differences in pathophysiology between this model and the human condition, which may limit the ability to extrapolate our results.
