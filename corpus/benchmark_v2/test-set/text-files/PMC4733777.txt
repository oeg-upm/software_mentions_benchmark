Quantitative coronary angiography was performed using standard quantitative analyses and definitions. [13] A main principle of our QCA approach was to ensure as little observer interference as possible. Angiograms obtained at baseline and before MV stenting were analyzed with the use of a computer-based system dedicated to bifurcation analysis (Qangio XA, version 7.3, Medis, Leiden, the Netherlands). We obtained quantitative angiographic measurements of the four segments of the bifurcation lesion: The proximal MV segment, the distal MV segment, the SB segment and the bifurcation core segment Figure 2]. Bifurcation core is defined as the central part of the bifurcation which begins where the common vessel starts to split into two branches and ends at the carinal point, [14] which area was calculated by the Qangio XA software. We also obtained the bifurcation angle (the angle between the distal MV and the SB) from the analysis system.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of SB occlusion. The covariates that were either statistically significant on univariate analysis (P < 0.25) or considered important were included in the multivariate model. Totally, 28 covariates were employed in the multivariate model, including diabetes, previous PCI, medina classification, plaque location,reference diameter of the proximal and distal MV, reference diameter of the SB, preprocedural percent diameter stenosis of the proximal MV, preprocedural percent diameter stenosis of the distal MV, true bifurcation lesions, lesion length of the MV and SB, bifurcation angle, predilation of the SB and jailed wire in SB. Estimates of the adjusted differences in risks are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the difference. All P values were two-tailed, and a P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 system (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
