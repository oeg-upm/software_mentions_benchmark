â€¢ C for 30 min, and the eluted proteins were precipitated and separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE. Sliver staining was carried out using ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain Kit (Sigma) based on manufacturer's instructions. The interesting protein bands were excised and identified by mass spectrometry by Alphalyse Inc. Briefly, the samples were reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide, followed by trypsin digestion. The digested peptides were concentrated and analyzed on a Bruker Autoflex Speed MALDI TOF/TOF instrument. MALDI MS/MS was conducted on 15 peptides for peptide fragmentation analysis. The MS and MS/MS spectra were combined and used to search database with the Mascot software. Alternatively, the isolated proteins were analyzed by western blot.
