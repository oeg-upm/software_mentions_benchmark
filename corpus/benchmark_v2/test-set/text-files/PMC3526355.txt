Lymphocytes were isolated from organs of PBS-perfused mice and stimulated with 1 µg/ml GP33 + 1 µg/ml NP396 peptide in the presence of 10 µg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 h at 37°C. For analysis of degranulation, 1 µl CD107a was added during the stimulation. Surface staining was conducted for 30 min at 4°C. Afterward, cells were fixed and permeabilized in 500 µl 2× FACS Lyse (BD) with 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and intracellular staining was conducted for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS containing 1% PFA (Sigma-Aldrich). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using an LSRII flow cytometer in combination with FACSDiva software (both BD). Raw data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Histopathology. Multiple liver lobes were taken from PBS-perfused mice, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were cut in a cryostat and stained with H&E. For lung histology, multiple lobes were taken from nonperfused mice and fixed in PBS buffered formalin. Fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin and sections were stained with H&E at the Cantonal Hospital, St. Gallen, Switzerland. All sections were examined by a pathologist blinded to the specific experimental conditions. Immunofluorescence. Isolated nonperfused lungs were immersed in BSS, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and cut in a cryostat. For cryopreservation, 10-µm tissue sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min. After thawing, tissue sections were air dried and TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol for the In situ Cell Death Detection kit TMR red (Roche). For surface stainings, sections were incubated with CD31 Alex-648 (LucernaChem) in a humidified chamber for 2 h at room temperature and nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Images were acquired on the confocal microscope LSM 710 (Carl Zeiss) and processed using the ZEN 2009 (Carl Zeiss) software and DRAW X4 (Corel).
