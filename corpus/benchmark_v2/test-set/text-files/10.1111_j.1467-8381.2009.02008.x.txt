The CGE model we describe in this section is the GTAP6inGAMS model developed by Rutherford (2005).
14 The model has three economic agents: producers, representative consumers (private and public) and trading partners. The GTAP6inGAMS model is a traditional static Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium model in which the zero profit condition and market clearance define the equilibrium. The GTAP6inGAMS is a modified version of the GTAP model version 6 developed for GAMS users. Most of the model specifications are the same as the GTAP model. The differences between the GTAP model and GAMS version of the model are as follows. First, the GTAP model is based on a constant difference elasticity demand system, but the GAMS model uses Cobb-Douglas preferences. Second, the GTAP model assumes that global capital is endogenously allocated by regional rates of return. However, for 12. They, however, propose to achieve the bigger trade blocs by utilizing ASEAN as the hub for the integration (e.g. the three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA), which is not desirable based on the empirical analysis in the present paper.
13. An income terms of a trade measure, the purchasing power of exports in terms of imports (the ratio of the value of exports to the price of imports), can be a better measure of income or welfare effect of price changes in international trade, especially for developing countries, relative to the net barter terms of trade. See Chacholiades (1990, pp. 136-7). 14. The explanation of the CGE model used in this paper is derived from Park (2006). simplicity, the GTAP6inGAMS model exogenously fixes the global capital flows. The model described in the present paper uses a classification consisting of 7 sectors and 25 economies, as in Park (2006). 15 The model solution has been calibrated, with 2001 as the base year, using global trade, assistance and production data from the GTAP 6 Database. 16 The model has been implemented using the GAMS MPSGE. 17 The GTAP6inGAMS model is adopted because the CGE model is in line with the commonly used GTAP model and the solver, GAMS MPSGE, is simple and easy to handle.
To quantitatively measure the impacts of the proposed East Asian RTAs on welfare, output production and trade flows for each of the participating countries, members as a whole, nonmembers and the world economy, we empirically designed and tested four scenarios. For each of the scenarios, both import tariffs and export taxes between members were eliminated, but the trade 15. The seven sectors are: agricultural products, food products, extractive industry, light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, technology-intensive manufacturing, and services. The 27 economies are: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the rest of Southeast Asia, China, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, the USA, the European Free Trade Association, the Western European countries, and the rest of the world. 16. The GTAP 6 Database is a global database representing the world economy for a given reference year (2001). For more detailed information, see Dimaranan (2006For the base solution of the model economy, we ran the CGE model without changing its initial condition and derived general equilibrium values for each of the economies in the model. Next, we reestimated the model under different scenarios and recalculated the equilibrium values for each case. Then, we compared the different equilibrium values with the initial base solution in terms of percentage deviation from the base to evaluate the experimental impacts of each scenario on each country.
Table 2 provides a comparative summary of regional economic effects of the proposed East Asian RTAs by type of RTA. The aggregate effect of the currently effective AFTA had no significant negative effects on the discriminatory liberalization of the Northeast Asian neighbors, but produced significant enough positive gains to ASEAN members. However, if ASEAN members decide to pursue the ASEAN Hub scenario, which includes three sets of ASEAN+1 FTA, it could raise ASEAN's gains from free trade. ASEAN's welfare and GDP gains could be raised to more than three times that of the AFTA. The negative effects on excluded neighbors could be problematic, although the neighboring countries 18. The trade barriers include both tariff and non-tariff barriers. For import tariffs, trade-weighted ad valorem tariffs include tariff rate quotas and the ad valorem equivalents of specific tariffs. The export taxes cover ordinary export subsidies, export tax equivalents of Agreement on Textiles and Clothing quotas, price undertakings and voluntary export restraints. The protection rates in service sectors are assumed to be zero in the GTAP Database. For more detailed information, visit https:// www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/databases/v6/v6_doco.asp. 19. As the referee indicated, the base year for existing RTA, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, should be 2004 or 2005 (right before the year into force in Table 1). However, similar to other hypothetical scenarios in the present paper, the complete elimination of trade barriers between ASEAN and China are assumed and simulated. Of course, we acknowledge this data problem as a limitation.could increase their exports because of the income effect from the additional GDP gains of ASEAN, with the increase in bilateral trade volume between ASEAN and each of the three Northeast Asian countries. In terms of the negative effects that could be expected from AFTA or the ASEAN Hub scenario, the Northeast Asian neighbors might decide to form their own regional protection strategy against ASEAN by developing a ChinaJapan-Korea FTA. The trade warfare between the two regions could be harmful to the less-developed ASEAN economy and would enormously benefit the Northeast Asian countries, especially the smallest country, like Korea. However, this duplicating RTA competition might not be beneficial to the world economy. It will cause much lower welfare gains to the world economy than those with the existing AFTA and ASEAN Hub scenario.
