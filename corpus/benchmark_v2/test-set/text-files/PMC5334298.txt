Genomic reads were initially mapped to the reference genome using a fast algorithm. These initial mappings were both expanded and refined by a form of local de novo assembly in all regions of the genome that appeared to contain variations based on these initial mappings. The de novo assembly fully leverages mate-pair information, allowing reads to be recruited into variants with higher sensitivity than genome-wide mapping methods alone typically provide. Assemblies were diploid, and sequencing produced two separate result sequences for each locus in diploid regions. Variants were called by independently comparing each of the diploid assemblies to the reference. The original computational methods for small variant detection are available at: http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/ full/10.1089/cmb.2011.0201. These methods have evolved over the development of further Analysis Pipeline versions.
Predicted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared using National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) dbSNP version 137 to annotate known SNP information. Each SNP was mapped on the genomic features of the UCSC gene table, such as coding region, untranslational region, and intron. Non-synonymous SNP information was extracted by comparing UCSC reference gene information (http://genome.Ucsc.edu/). Information on cancer-related mutations was obtained from the cosmic cancer information database (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/ cancergenome/projects/cosmic/). The Ingenuity Molecule Annotation System (MAS) (http://bioinfo.capitalbio.com/ mas3/) was used for functional interaction analysis of the genes affected. The MAS is a whole data-mining and function annotation solution used to extract and analyze biological molecule relationships from a public knowledge base of biological molecules and signification.
The MAS was used to determine and plot the alterations of genes and signaling pathways. Indeed, two genes in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, EGFR and CACNA1C, were found either mutated or amplified in lung adenocarcinoma tissue (Fig S2) and other cancer-related pathways also harbored multiple mutations (Fig S3). Activation of the MAPK pathway can result in a multitude of physiological effects, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, mitosis, and the transcription of several classes of genes. EGFR was found in telomerase, cellular aging, and immortality pathways and plays a role in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the regulation of cellular apoptosis (Fig 4).
