For all the studies from which we constructed the 2 Ã— 2 table, pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and the diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated using the bivariate model. [17] The summarized receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed. In diagnostic test, heterogeneity was commonly caused by threshold effect. When threshold effect existed, there was a negative correlation between sensitivity and specificity. Heterogeneity caused by the threshold effect was evaluated by Spearman's correlation coefficient. If there were more than one threshold in an article, the threshold with the largest Youden index was chosen. The percentage of the total variation across studies was described by the I 2 statistic, which indicated the existence of significant heterogeneity when the value exceeded 50%. The value of I 2 ranges from 0 to 100%, with 0 implying no observed heterogeneity, and larger values indicating increasing heterogeneity. [18] The random effects model was chosen due to the expected clinical and statistical heterogeneity among the studies. [17] For all effect estimates, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using Meta-Disc software (version 14.0, Unit of Clinical Biostatistics team, Madrid, Spain).
