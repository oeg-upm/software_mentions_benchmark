Nucleosomes were assembled on 54A18 DNA fragments for RSC and SWI/SNF repositioning and 54A0 DNA fragments for Chd1 repositioning. Each 10 ml reaction contained 1 pmol of wild-type and mutant nucleosomes assembled on cy3 and cy5 labelled DNA, respectively, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP and the quantity of remodeller specified in figures. Samples were incubated in 0.2-ml thin walled PCR tubes (ABgene, UK) in an Eppendorf mastercycle with heated lid at 308C for the times specified in figures, before reaction termination by transferal to ice and addition of 500 ng of HindIII-digested bacteriophage lambda competitor DNA (Promega, USA) and 5% (w/v) sucrose. Samples were resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel [5% acrylamide:bis acrylamide (49:1 ratio), 0.2 Â TBE buffer (0.5 mM EDTA, 22.3 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3), 0.1% APS and 0.1% TEMED]. Gels were cast horizontally between 20 by 20-cm glass plates using 1.5-mm Teflon spacers, before mounting vertically in the gel apparatus (Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) and pre-running at 300 V for 3 h with continuous pump recirculation of 0.2 Â TBE buffer between the upper and lower compartments at 48C. Gels were run at 300 V for 3.5 h and imaged using a Phosphoimager FLA-5100 (Fujifilm, Japan). Gel band intensities were quantitated using AIDA software (Raytest, Germany). The proportion of nucleosomes repositioned was calculated as the intensity of the sum of all detectable products over the sum of the major initial position plus products. In many assembly reactions a proportion of nucleosomes are assembled at a minor assembly location marked as the P position (e.g. Ã in Figure 2A) (18). Including this band in the calculations was found not to significantly affect the determination of initial rates. In some histone mutants the proportion of nucleosomes assembled at the P position was altered, and some additional less abundant sites of deposition were also observed. However, again inclusion nucleosomes assembled at these locations was not found to significantly affect the comparison of initial rates. As a result, in the analysis presented here nucleosomes deposited at locations other than the major NucA locations are not in included in quantitation. For some mutations a small proportion of nucleosomes were observed to undergo thermal repositioning in control reactions lacking remodelling enzyme. However, this was generally detected after long incubations and the proportion of nucleosomes repositioned at early time points was low enough not to affect the calculation of initial rates. The reproducibility of the assay when carried out in this manner was found to be high (Supplementry Figure 1).
