Interaction screen. We used the following set of query proteins: Cdc42, Cdc24, Bem2, Bem3, Rga1 and Rga2, Rdi1, Bem1 and Cla4. Physical and genetic interaction partners were collected from public databases (BioGRID 58 , MPACT 59 ). Physical interactions included data from affinity purification, co-crystallization, FRET, PCA, protein-peptide interaction, reconstituted complexes and two-hybrid. Genetic interactions represented synthetic growth defects, haploinsufficiencies and synthetic lethality. We only considered negative interactions from synthetic genetic array screens. Interaction partners involved in actin-related processes were grouped in four categories: actin general (actin patches or cables), early secretion (ER-toGolgi transport), late secretion (Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport) and endocytic recycling. All identified interactions are listed in Supplementary Tables S1,S2. For each query the number of interactions with members of each category were extracted. The number of unique interactions in each functional group served as a measure of the overall strength of interaction with that group and was colourcoded in a heat map (see Fig. 1a).and an iXON DU-897 EMCCD camera (Andor) coupled to a Â 2 magnification ring. Images were acquired with Metamorph 7.0 software.
Statistics and data analysis. Curve fitting for polarization curves was done with Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla) using a sigmoidal dose-response equation y ¼ bottom þ (top-bottom)/(1 þ 10^((LogEC50-X)*Hill Slope)). Unpaired twotailed t-tests were performed to validate significance of differences.
