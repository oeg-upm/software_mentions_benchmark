All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The categorical data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Parametric data were analyzed using the student's t-test. Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or number (percentage). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare changes of vital signs during 180 minutes after drug administration between two groups. Results: 66 participants were enrolled. Figure 1 shows the CON-SORT flow diagram of study. The mean age of participants was 2.8 ± 1.6 years (range: 6 months to 6 years) and 54.5% of the participants were male. Table 1 shows the basic characteristics of patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in age, height, weight, and male to female ratio (Table 1). Table 2 compares outcomes between two groups. Adequate sedation (RSS of 4) was achieved in five patients (15.2%) in the OM group and 15 patients (45.5%) in the OMK group, which showed a statistically significant difference (p = 0.015). No significant difference was found between the groups in time of achieving adequate sedation (p = 0.854) and the time of discharging from radiology department (p = 0.223). Adverse effects observed in two patients (one with nausea and another with vomiting) in the OM group and three patients (two with nausea and one patient with vomiting) in the OMK group. Complications were minor and transient and did not differ between study groups (p > 0.05). No serious adverse events were seen in the study participant. Systolic blood pressure, SaO2 level, pulse rate, and respiratory rateshowed no significant inter-group differences at baseline and at various time points after administration of the drugs (for all analysis: df = 18, p > 0.05, Figure 2).
