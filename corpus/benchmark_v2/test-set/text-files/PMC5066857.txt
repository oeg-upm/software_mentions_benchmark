The data were entered into a specially designed database in Microsoft ACCESS. 15 For the initial review, all abstracts and full-text articles were independently read by two reviewers (RET, Wendy Spragins) to determine relevance, with any disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (Diane Lorenzetti). To maximize sensitivity in detecting cases, we assessed any report whose title, abstract, or text proposed that a patient had suffered one of the abovementioned serious adverse events after YF vaccination. The systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 16 guidelines.
