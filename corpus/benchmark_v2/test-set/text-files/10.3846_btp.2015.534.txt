The case study presents the use of fuzzy logic at evaluation of total project risk base on RIPRAN method. The Fuzzy logic Toolbox of the MATLAB software was used for the creating of the decision making model. At first is it necessary to design the variables, their attributes and their membership functions.
For implementation of fuzzy model in MATLAB software was created executable file called "M-file". This file contains the following sequence of commands (Fig. 10). This file is used to enter the input values (NSR, TVSR) and automatically evaluate the total value of project risk (TVPR).
The advantage of this fuzzy model is the ability to transform the input variables The Number od SUb-Risks (NSR) and The Total Value of Sub-Risk (TVSR) to linguistic variables, as well linguistic evaluated The Total Value Project RIsk (TVPR) -output variable. With this approach it is possible to simulate an uncertainty that is always associated with projects. After the fuzzy model is constructed, it is necessary to tune it (to set up the inputs on known values, evaluate the results and to change the rules or weights, if necessary) when the model was built. If the fuzzy model is tuned, it is possible to use it in practice. For implement the fuzzy model in MATLAB can also created an executable file called M-File. M-file is used to enter the input values and automatically evaluate the total risk of the project.
