All results are expressed as mean Â± SD unless otherwise stated. We performed risk factor analysis for vertebral fracture using logistic regression model. Group comparisons for BMD were conducted with the Student t-test. FRAX prediction of vertebral fracture and hip fracture using femoral neck BMD in the Korean, Japanese, USA and UK models were assessed using the ANOVA methods. FRAX prediction of vertebral fracture using lumbar spine BMD in the Korean, Japanese, USA and UK models were assessed using the ANOVA methods. Each result was analyzed using the SPSS ver. 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and a p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
