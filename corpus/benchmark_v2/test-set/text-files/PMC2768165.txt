Transmission electron microscopy. Four-month-old mice pretreated with HFD for 8 weeks were used. Muscles were isolated, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M Sorenson's buffer (PH 7.2), and treated with 1% OsO4 also in Sorenson's buffer for 1 h. After dehydration and embedment in Lx-112 (Ladd Research Industries), thin sections (60 nm) were cut using a MT-7000 ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined under a JEOL JEM-1200 EXII electron microscope. Pictures were captured by an ORCA-HR digital camera (Hamamatsu) and recorded with an AMT Image Capture Engine. Indirect calorimetry. Twenty-week-old weight-matched male MCK-DGAT1 mice and wild-type littermates that had been on a HFD for 8 weeks were singly housed in metabolic chambers. After 2-4 days of adaptation, oxygen consumption, locomotor activity, and respiration exchange ratio were measured continuously over at least 5 days during 12:12 light-dark cycles, using a CLAMS (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) open-circuit indirect calorimetry system as previously described (27). RT-PCR, Western blot, DGAT activity, and triglyceride contents. Fourmonth-old mice with 8-week HFD pretreatment were used for these experiments. RT-PCR (3,28) and Western blot (3,29) were as described. Genespecific primer sets are listed in supplemental Table 1. Primary antibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)4, uncoupling protein (UCP)-3, CD36, and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). DGAT activity was measured in vitro using [ 14 C]-labeled palmitoyl-CoA as previously described (29,30). The method to quantify muscle triglyceride content was as described (3,29). Statistical analysis. Statistical differences were first analyzed by ANOVA to determine overall treatment effects (genotype or exercise), followed by post hoc comparisons between concerned study groups (Statistica V6.0, StatSoft, OK). A two-tailed P value of Ͻ0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. For indirect calorimetry measurements, ANOVA repeated measures (Prism,GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) were used. Post hoc analyses were conducted using Tukey post hoc or Bonferroni comparisons. Data are expressed as means Ϯ SE.
