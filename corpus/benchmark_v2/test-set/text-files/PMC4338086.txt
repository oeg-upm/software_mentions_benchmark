Statistical analyses were performed using PASW ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables were presented as meanÂ±SD. The paired t-test was used to compare normally distributed data, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used otherwise. Two-sided P-values of less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance.
