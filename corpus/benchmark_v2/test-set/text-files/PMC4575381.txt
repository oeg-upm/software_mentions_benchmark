Model distribution and covariate selection were based on maximizing the log-likelihood and minimizing the Akaike information criterion. The proportional hazards assumption was tested by graphical inspection and by exploring whether the included covariates significantly varied over time. The statistical analysis was executed using Stata 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
