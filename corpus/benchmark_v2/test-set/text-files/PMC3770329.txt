Cell culture. NIH3T3, MEFs, MCF10a and primary keratinocyte cells were maintained as described in 11,33,42,43, respectively. Generation of ecotropic mGFP and GFP-H3 virus and cell transduction was carried out as previously described. 18 Transfection of NIH3T3 cells with nontargeting and ROCK1 Smartpool (Dharmacon, Loughborough, UK) siRNA was performed as previously described. 42 Murine RAW-264.7 macrophages were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.Microscopy. Time-lapse microscopy images were acquired with a Â 20 lens using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a heated stage and 5% CO 2 gas line. Gray scale image is transmitted light. Cells were grown on optical glass coverslips and apoptosis was induced in a starved medium supplemented with TNFa/CHX and 5 mg/ml PI. Immediately after the induction of apoptosis, cells were relocated to confocal microscope and time-lapse images were taken every 30 s for 8 h in both transmitted light and red fluorescence. High resolution still images of unfixed apoptotic cells were acquired with a Â 60 oil immersion lens using same conditions as above. The medium was further supplemented with FAST DiO (3,3'-dilinoleyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate; Invitrogen) diluted 1 : 500 from 2.5 mg/ml dissolved in 100% DMSO. Transmission and SEM was performed as described in 33 N 4 (Silantes, Munich, Germany). Label incorporation was determined to be 495% by MS before cells were used for further experiments. Each labeled population of NIH3T3 were assigned specific treatments, for example, light, control; medium, TNFa/ CHX; and heavy, TNFa/CHX þ Y27632. Each labeled population was used in each treatment condition, with Blebbistatin substituting for Y27632 in one set of experiments, for a total of six replicates. After 4 h, the supernatants were pooled and concentrated with StrataClean resin. Protein was eluted from StrataClean resin using 100 ml 1X lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) sample buffer plus 10 mM DTT at 951C for 5 min. This was allowed to cool, adjusted to 50 mM iodoacetamide and incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature. Macrophage extracts (in 8 M urea) were adjusted to 1X LDS sample buffer, reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide as described above. The samples were electrophoresed for 3 cm on a NuPAGE 4-12% gel using MOPS running buffer (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) at 200 V and then stained with colloidal coomasie. The gel lane was cut into five even sections, each section cut into 2-mm cubes, destained with 50% acetonitrile/100 mM TEAB pH 8, dried and digested with 1 mg/ml trypsin in 50 mM TEAB overnight at 301C. Gel pieces were extracted with 50% acetonitrile, extracts combined, dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 0.1 ml 5% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid in water. In some experiments, macrophage extracts (50 mg) were reduced and alkylated in 8 M urea, diluted to 1 M urea with 50 mM TEAB pH 8 and digested in solution with trypsin (1 : 10 w/w) at 301C for 5 h. Tryptic digests were analyzed by LC-MS on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer system coupled to a Proxeon Easy-LC HPLC system. The peptide mixtures were loaded onto a nanoseparations C18 guard column (0.1 Â 20 mm) equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water at 5 ml/min and then separated on an LC-Packings PepMap C18 column (0.075 Â 150 mm equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water. Peptides were eluted with a 120 min discontinuous gradient of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The column outlet was connected to a Proxeon Flex nanospray source fitted with a New Objective FS360 20-10 uncoated emitter and a voltage of 2 kV was applied to the emitter. The orbitrap was set to analyze the survey scans (m/z 350-2000) at 30 000 resolution and top 10 ions in each duty cycle (minimum ion intensity of 5000 cps) were selected for MSMS in the LTQ linear ion trap. Ions were excluded for 20 s after two occurrences. The raw files were analyzed using MaxQuant 1.2.0.13 and Proteome Discoverer 1.3 (Thermo- Fisher, Loughborough, UK) against mouse Swiss-Prot database (2012_09, 55744 entries) database. The Maxquant/ Andromedia search was performed with the following criteria (Raw mass spectra were extracted by  MaxQuant (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany, version 1.3.0.5) and searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.50 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 6 p.p.m. Trypsin was set as the enzyme with two missed cleavages permitted. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification. SILAC labels of lysine and arginine, oxidation of methionine and acetyl of the protein N-terminus were specified as variable modifications. The identification criteria included peptide length to be greater than 7 amino acids residues and both peptide and protein FDR levels set at 0.01 (or 1 if the data were submitted to Scaffold Q þ S (Proteome Software version 3.6, Portland, OR, USA). Analysis was undertaken both with and without re-quantify active. Proteome Discoverer 1.3 was used to search with Mascot using a SILAC (K8/R10) workflow and peptides were validated using Percolator 1.17 (University of Washington) with a FDR of 0.1%. The Mascot search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) used the following criteria: peptide tolerance ¼ 10 p.p.m., MSMS tolerance ¼ 0.8 Da, trypsin as the enzyme (two missed cleavages permitted), carboxyamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification with oxidation of methionine and label K8, label R10 as a variable modification. The output from both Maxquant and Proteome Discoverer 1.3 were processed through Scaffold Q þ S and the data from each gel section from each lane were combined into one file. Gene ontology analysis was performed using GeneGo (Thomson Reuters).
