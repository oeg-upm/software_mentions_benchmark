Cells on coverslips were cold treated for 1 h at 4°C and then fixed in methanol at 20°C for 10 min. The cells were washed in PBS, blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS, and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. The cells were washed with PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-, Alexa Fluor 568-, or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). DNA was counterstained with DAPI. The samples were mounted in Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories) and viewed on a confocal system (LSM 700; Carl Zeiss) with a Plan Apochromat 100×/1.4 NA oil-immersion objective. Images were acquired with the ZEN or AimImage Browser software (Carl Zeiss).
