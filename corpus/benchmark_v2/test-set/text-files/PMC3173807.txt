Estimates of the number of persons living with HIV have been the major focus of routine monitoring and reporting on HIV epidemics. However, a number of problems have been identified with the reliance on prevalence as an indicator for analysing the impact of HIV programs. During the early phases of an epidemic prevalence grows rapidly, but changes in the slope due to saturation and to program impact are difficult to separate. After several years HIV prevalence tends to plateau, with new infections and deaths balancing each other out. An effective program introduced as this plateau phase begins may induce a gradual decline in prevalence, but this decline may be difficult to distinguish from mortality-related declines. Several years ago, the global epidemic entered a plateau phase, with most countries in sub-Saharan Africadwhere the majority of people living with HIV residedshowing stable or only slowly declining HIV prevalence. As a result, in 2007 UNAIDS began to focus more attention on new infections, that is, incidence, as a more informative measure of global progress. 11 In response, the UNAIDS Reference Group recommended that the tools UNAIDS prepares to assist countries in analysing their epidemics, EPP and Spectrum, shift to a focus on incidence. 12 This change was made in the 2009 version of the software, which still fits prevalence data, but provides incidence from the model along with prevalence as outputs. Because incidence is derived by fitting prevalence, it reflects an averaged national trend in new infections and may not capture short-term rises and falls in incidence occurring in specific groups or geographical areas.
