In a case-control study, cases and controls ideally match on all characteristics except the variable of interest. In order to consider the confounding effects of unmatched characteristics, we treated them as covariates in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Variables with P values less than 0.2 for differences between the two groups were considered to be covariates: these included age, marital status, literacy, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Results were reported as meanÂ±standard deviation for quantitative variables and percentages for categorical variables. The groups were compared using the Student's t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test as appropriate) for categorical variables. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for OR were calculated. To decrease the effects of probable confounders, adjusted ORs were estimated when appropriate. Results for which P values were 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
