In silico search for binding sites in BOB.1/OBF.1 promoters of different species was performed using the MatInspector tool (Matrix Family Library Version 8.3) of the Genomatrix software tool (Genomatrix Company).
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche). Quantitative PCR were performed using qPCR-SYBR-Green (Roche). Primers ordered from Biomers were designed using 'Universal Probe Library Assay Design Center' Software (Roche). Primer sequences are given in Supplementary Table S2. Quantification of gene regulation was performed by the ÁÁCp method using RPL13 as house-keeping gene.
We next wondered whether the same pharmacological inhibitors could influence the activity of the known BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter. Therefore, a reporter construct harboring the previously described 1500 bp BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter (34) was transiently transfected into Jurkat T cells, which were either left untreated or pre-treated with inhibitors for CN, NF-kB or p38 for 30 min before the stimulation with P/I. These experiments revealed that the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter is sensitive to all of the analysed inducers and inhibitors, similar to the octamer-dependent reporter (Figure 1B). To explore whether protein expression of BOB.1/OBF.1 mirrors its promoter activity, Jurkat T cells and primary CD4 + cells isolated from lymph nodes of C57BL/6 wild-type mice were either left untreated or pre-treated for 30 min with the inhibitors used in the previous experiments and subsequently stimulated with P/I. Interestingly, we found a striking coregulation of Oct2 and BOB.1/OBFInterestingly, EMSA studies (Supplementary Figure S1) revealed that the NF-kB inhibitor Bay11-7082 inhibits additionally NFAT binding to DNA and, vice versa, the CN inhibitors CsA and FK506 interfere with NFAT binding but also with the NF-kB signaling pathway, as it was described recently (44,45). Therefore, the observed effect of CsA and FK506 on BOB.1/OBF.1 expression is not only mediated by inhibiting NFAT activity, as these compounds also affect the activity of NF-kB, but rather by the combined activity of NFAT and NF-kB. However, treatment of murine primary CD4 + T cells or transfected Jurkat cells with specific NFAT and NF-kB signaling pathway inhibitors, like the NFAT inhibitory peptide 11 R-VIVIT and the NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO)-binding peptide, respectively, clearlyThe BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter contains several binding sites for NFAT and NF-iB Previously, the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter was analysed to identify regulatory elements responsible for its activity in B cells (34-36). In those studies, a functional cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/Activating Transcription Factor (ATF) site could be identified, which is crucial for the B lymphocyte specific activity of the promoter. In addition, a sequence related to a NFAT binding site was described, however without any functional relevance for the B cell-specific BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter activity. In search for possible additional transcription factor binding sites using the Genomatrix Software, we identified two combined NFAT/NF-kB binding sites within the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter. Both newly identified sites are conserved between rat, mouse and man, suggesting a possible functional relevance of these regulatory elements. In contrast to B cells, where a function of the predicted NFAT binding site has not been revealed (34), an inducible complex formation could be detected after P/I treatment of primary CD4 + T cells. This complex resembles that formed at the NFAT site of the IL2 promoter used in control experiments (Figure 2 Figure S2). Together, our data suggest that NFAT and NF-kB family members are able to bind to all of these newly identified potential cis-acting elements of the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter in vitro.
