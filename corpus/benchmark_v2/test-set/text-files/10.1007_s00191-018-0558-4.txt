We use the Matérn v = 5 2 covariance function, which is the default one inDiceKriging-package of R Development Core Team (2009):
As soon as we have a satisfying metamodel L, we determine the pair (φ * π , φ * u ) that minimizes the estimated value of loss L, denoted by L * . This is done through the packages rgenoud (R-GENetic Optimization Using Derivatives, see Mebane and Sekhon 2011) and DiceOptim (see Roustant et al. 2010) provided by R Development Core Team (2009). This is a quite powerful optimization function that efficiently combines evolutionary algorithm methods for global purpose with a derivative-based (quasi-Newton) method for local search of optima.
