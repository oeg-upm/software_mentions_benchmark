Statistical analysis. All cell proliferation assays were performed at least twice at different times. The repeated experiments gave comparable results. The comparative statistical evaluations between the different cell line conditions were performed by two-way ANOVA with treatment concentration and cell line condition as variables. For post hoc testing, a multiple comparative test with Dunn-Šidák correction was used. For RT-qPCR experiments, normalised relative gene expression values were calculated using qBasePLUS software version 1.5 (Biogazelle, Zwijnaarde, Belgium). Messenger RNA expression was normalised to household gene expression (GAPDH and RPL13A for BON-1; HPRT and YWAZ for QGP-1) according to the geNorm algorithm (Mestdagh et al, 2009). Comparison between gene expression levels was done by Student's t-test and adjusted for multiple testing using Holm-Bonferroni correction. All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).reduces growth by 50% (IC 50 ) after 7 days of treatment was 1 and 4 nM, respectively (data not shown). Starting from this IC 50 concentration, QGP-1 and BON-1 were continuously cultured in increasing concentrations of everolimus. The everolimus concentration was progressively doubled every 14 days during 8-10 dose doublings until a final concentration of 1 mM was reached. In parallel, clonal BON-1 and QGP-1 cells were long-term vehicle treated. The established long-term everolimus-treated cell lines (BON-1/R and QGP-1/R) were maintained in the maximally achieved everolimus concentration. No morphological changes were seen between the long-term vehicle-treated cell lines and the long-term everolimus-treated cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2). After the establishment of the long-term everolimus-treated BON-1/R and QGP-1/R, both showed a statistically significant reduced growth inhibitory response to everolimus in comparison with longterm vehicle-treated BON-1 and QGP-1 at everolimus concentrations between 10 nM and 1 mM for BON-1/R and at 1 nM and 1 mM for QGP-1/R, respectively Figure 2A and B). In addition, BON-1/ R and QGP-1/R had a significantly reduced sensitivity to rapamycin in concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 1 mM when compared with their long-term vehicle-treated BON-1 and QGP-1 counterparts (Figure 2C and D).
