In this study 103 arthritic hips without secondary pathologies undergoing total hip arthroplasty have been considered. Cases with previous surgery of the ipsilateral hip, avascular necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis or other rheumatic diseases, tumors, history of hip disease in childhood or adolescence and peripheral vascular disease have been excluded. No patient was using platelet aggregation inhibitors, coumarin derivate or was subjected to heparin prior to surgery. Anesthesia of patients was performed with lumbar spinal block, using heavy bupivacaine 20 mg and 0.1 mg morphine. Patients were placed in contralateral lateral position to perform a posterior-lateral approach. After opening the fascia lata and muscle and repair of tendons of the external rotator muscles of the hip, articular exposure with the opening of the posterior capsule was performed. The posterior hip dislocation with maximum flexion and internal rotation exposes the femoral head for visualization of the four quadrants (anterior, posterior, superior and inferior). (Figure 1) After completion of the exposure of the joint surface, a puncture was performed in the middle of each quadrant with a 3.2 mm drill with a 10 mm depth lock. The bleeding was observed and qualified by registering it as early bleeding (EB: immediate to 10 seconds), late bleeding (LB: after 10 seconds) or without bleeding (WB). (Figure 2) This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and the patients signed a Free and Informed Consent form. Among the variables analyzed, gender, age, laterality, body mass index (BMI), degree of osteoarthritis and bleeding according to the quadrant of the femoral head were included. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18, with a 95% confidence interval.
