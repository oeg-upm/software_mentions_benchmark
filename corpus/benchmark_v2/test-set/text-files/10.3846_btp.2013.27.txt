With the help of statistical software SpSS 20.0 the authors run of the regressions and test the possible violations of the regression assumptions. Table 2 shows the correlation matrix of the independent variables used in the regressions. High correlation (r = -0.771) between the strategic and local ow nership is observed as indicated in the table 2, which couldhave been supposed by the authors as the majority of strategic investors in CEE companies are foreign institutions. This high correlation might lead to the multicollinearity problem in the regression, thus, it would be worth to omit one of these variables in the final regression model. Running the regression models shows that the owners hip structure has higher impact on the dividend payout ratio than on the dividend yield: F test (Dp -dependent variable) is 38.19 vs. F test (DY -dependent variable) is 18.54. It should be noted that both of the regressions ap pear to be significant due to the high F test values, despite the fact that adjusted R in the case with the dividend yield regression model is 2.5% and in the case with the dividend payout regression model it is 9.6% (Tables 3, 4).Dividend payout Ratio (Table 3): The regression results provide evidence that there is a significant positive relations hip between the dividend payout ratio and the strategic investors. Other variables do not seem to exert a significance influence on the amount of dividend payout.
