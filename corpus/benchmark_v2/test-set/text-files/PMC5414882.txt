To induce systemic AML, 10 6 C1498 cells were injected IV through the lateral tail vein. For in vivo CD4 C and CD8 C T-cell depletion, anti-CD4 (L3T4) and anti-CD8a (2.43) antibodies (BioXCell) were administered intra-peritoneal (IP) at a dose of 200 mg on day ยก1, and 100 mg on day 0, and every 3 d thereafter until day 14. To induce localized tumor growth, 10 6 C1498 cells were inoculated subcutaneously (SC) in the lower lateral abdominal wall. Tumor growth was monitored 2-3 times per week with calipers, and mean tumor diameter was recorded.. Rabbit anti-calreticulin monoclonal antibody and fluorescence-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG polyclonal secondary antibody were purchased from Abcam. Fixable viability dyes (Invitrogen) were used to exclude dead cells. Flow cytometry was performed on LSRII or LSRFortessa cytometers (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Treestar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences).
Grouped data were analyzed via two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests. Survival differences were analyzed with the Log-rank test. Statistics were performed using GraphPrism software. Data are presented as mean ยง SD unless otherwise indicated. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
