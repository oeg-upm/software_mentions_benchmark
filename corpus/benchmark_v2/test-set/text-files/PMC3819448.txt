(Fig. 1) (Fig. 2) A phylogenetic tree, which was constructed with the neighborjoining method by using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.05 [11], revealed this isolate to be W. confusa (Fig. 3). Empirical therapy with ceftriaxone was initiated after blood culture submission. In spite of the treatment, fever persisted for 3 days and the C-reactive protein level did not decrease. The ceftriaxone treatment was changed to teicoplanin plus piperacillin-tazobactam after isolation of gram-positive coccobacilli from the blood culture. Fever and other symptoms subsided with the new regimen. All subsequent blood cultures were negative, and the patient was discharged on the 9th hospital day with an uneventful recovery.
