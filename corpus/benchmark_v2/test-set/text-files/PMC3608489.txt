Bladder tissue was fixed and processed as described (Khandelwal et al., 2008); however, the Rab8 antibody only reacted if the following procedure was followed. After the frozen tissue was crosssectioned and rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), we performed antigen retrieval by incubating the tissue for 7 min with quench buffer (20 mM glycine, pH 8.0, and 75 mM NH 4 Cl dissolved in PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. This was followed by a 3-min incubation in quench buffer containing 0.05% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100. The tissue was then quickly rinsed three times with PBS and then three times for 5 min in the same buffer. When mounting the tissues, we found that enhanced image quality could be obtained if postfixation the tissues were rinsed with 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and then treated for 1-2 min each with ascending concentrations of thiodiethanol (50, 75, and 97% [vol/vol]) dissolved in the same buffer (Staudt et al., 2007). The samples were then mounted in 97% thiodiethanol/Tris buffer containing 0.01% (wt/vol) phenylenediamine and stored at −20°C. The 97% thiodiethanol has the same refractive index as our immersion oil (1.1518). Although this solution worked well for proteins labeled with secondary antibodies, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin and To-Pro3 were quickly leached out the samples, necessitating the use of our standard glycerol-based mounting medium for these markers (Acharya et al., 2004). Images were captured using an HCX PL APO 63×/numerical aperture (NA) 1.3 glycerol objective (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) or a Leica STED 100×/NA 1.4 oil objective and the appropriate laser lines of a Leica TCS SP5 CW-STED confocal microscope (in normal confocal mode). The photomultipliers were set at 900-1200, and 8-bit images were collected using four to eight line averages combined with four to eight frame averages. Serial 0.25-μm z-sections were acquired. The images were imported into Volocity 4D software (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and, after image reconstruction, exported as TIFF files. The contrast of the latter was corrected in Photoshop CS5 (Adobe, San Jose, CA), and the composite images were prepared in Adobe Illustrator CS5.
Measures of colocalization were performed using Volocity software, and Manders' colocalization coefficients were calculated as previously described (Khandelwal et al., 2008). Briefly, stacks of dual-labeled confocal sections were imported into Volocity, background noise was removed using the fine (3 × 3) median noise reduction filter, and a scatter plot of green and red pixel intensities (associated with each of the two markers in question) was generated using the colocalization function. A constant threshold of 40 was applied to both channels of the image stack, and Manders' colocalization coefficients for each of two markers (M X and M Y , respectively) were calculated for the entire three-dimensional image stack using the following equations (Manders et al., 1993):
Bladder tissue was isolated and then fixed with 2.0% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde and 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde in 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM CaCl 2 for 60 min. The tissue was then cut into small pieces, washed with 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, cut into small blocks (2-5 mm in size), and then postfixed in 1.0% (wt/vol) OsO 4 and 1.0% (wt/vol) K 4 Fe(CN) 6 , in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4. After a wash with water, the samples were en bloc stained overnight in 0.5% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate. The tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, and after incubation in propylene oxide, embedded in the epoxy resin LX-112 (Ladd, Burlington, VT) and cured 2 d at 60°C. Embedded tissue was sectioned with a diamond knife (Diatome, Fort Washington, PA), and sections, silver to pale gold in color, were mounted on Butvarcoated nickel grids, contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed at 80 kV in a 100 CX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Images were captured using an L9C Peltier-cooled transmission electron microscopy camera system (Scientific Instruments and Applications, Duluth, GA). Digital images were imported into Adobe Lightroom, and the images were processed by using the brightness, contrast, and clarity controls. When contrast was too low, adjustments to the tone curve were made to the whole image. Images were sharpened using a radius of 0.5, and luminance noise reduction was performed. The composite images were assembled using Adobe Illustrator CS5.
