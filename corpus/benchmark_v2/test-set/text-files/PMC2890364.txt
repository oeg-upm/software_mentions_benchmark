Results were analyzed using SPSS version15.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). A general linear model (repeated-measures ANOVA) was used, with order of session (euglycemia-hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia-euglycemia) as a between-subjects factor, and condition (euglycemia or hypoglycemia) as a within-subjects factor, to compare hypoglycemia with euglycemia. Additional analysis using paired t tests was performed to assess the change in any given parameter from baseline. A P value Ͻ0.05 was considered to be significant. Results are reported as mean Ϯ SD unless otherwise stated.
