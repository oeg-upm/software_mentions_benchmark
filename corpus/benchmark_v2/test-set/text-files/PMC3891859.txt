premolars and the first and second molars of each arch in this root shape analysis study. Tooth mortality was defined as the value obtained by adding the numbers of hopeless and missing teeth. The evaluation criterion for the hopeless category was an insufficient attachment level to maintain health, convenience, and function [14,15]. Following the clinical examination, full-mouth periapical radiographs were taken and analyzed for bone level, root deformity, or missing teeth using PiView STAR software (Infinitt Co., Seoul, Korea).
Data management procedures employed SPSS ver. 14.0. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The tooth mortality and root form distribution were analyzed using the chi-square test. Periodontal probing depth and clinical attachment loss by root form was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey or Dunnett T3 post hoc test.
