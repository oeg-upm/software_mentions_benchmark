After irradiation, muscles were washed once in KHB at 18°C to remove excess GP15 label and were then transferred to fresh KHB and incubated at 30°C to initiate internalization of the biotin-tagged GLUT4. At the specified internalization time points, 80 g/ml avidin (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) was added for 6 min at 30°C to block transporters that were still at the cell surface. Muscles were rinsed four times in ice-cold PBS, frozen directly in liquid nitrogen, and stored at Ϫ80°C until analysis. The maximum signal of GLUT4, which internalized and escaped the surface quenching, was determined in each experiment from insulin-or AICAR-stimulated samples that were returned to the basal state and allowed to internalize the biotinylated GLUT4 for 60 min. Initial GLUT4 signal was determined in samples incubated without the addition of avidin. Exocytosis of GLUT4. For exocytosis experiments, human vastus lateralis muscles or rat epitrochlearis muscles were incubated at 35 or 30°C, respectively. After 20 min, muscles were transferred to fresh KHB containing 12 nmol/l insulin. Insulin-stimulated muscles were photoaffinity labeled with GP15 and subsequently washed with MES buffer (KHB with MES replacing HEPES), pH 6.0, for 5 min to terminate insulin stimulation. Muscles were maintained in KHB for 40 min to obtain maximal internalization. To begin the determination of exocytosis, 160 g/ml avidin was added for 6 min. Thereafter, muscles were transferred to KHB with or without 120 nmol/l insulin or 1 mmol/l AICAR for specified times. The rate of loss of the internal transporters as they became quenched by the surface avidin was determined at the indicated time points. Curve fitting and analysis of rate constants. Values for net internalization of GLUT4 under steady-state conditions were curve fitted using a twoparameter equation: F ϭ (1.0 Ϫ E).exp(Ϫk.t) ϩ E, where F is the fraction of GLUT4 remaining at the surface, E is the equilibrium position for internalization, k is the net internalization-rate constant, and t is time. The contributions from exocytosis (kex) and endocytosis (ken) to the progress to equilibrium were determined using the following equation: F ϭ {kex ϩ ken.exp[Ϫt.(kex ϩ ken)]}/(kex ϩ ken) (11). Values for unidirectional exocytosis of GLUT4 were curve fitted to a single exponential equation: F ϭ exp(Ϫ k.t), where F is the fraction of GLUT4 remaining internal, and k is the exocytosis rate constant, and t is time. Individual experiments were analyzed, and the resulting parameters were used to obtain mean and SE values, which were then compared in unpaired t tests. Differences were considered significant at P Ͻ 0.05. Analysis and curve fitting were carried out using Graphpad Prism software.
