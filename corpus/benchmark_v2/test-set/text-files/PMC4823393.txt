For quantitative data evaluation, the median test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used. To objectify if transfusion and mortality were independent of the patient's temperature, age and GCS contingency tables were created and analysed with a Ï‡ 2 test. To compare means, Student's t test was used. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied to identify whether hypothermic and transfused patients had a higher risk of mortality than the other patients in the study. Binary logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for mortality. The univariate predictors were the body temperature and transfusion. The results are given in adjusted OR (AOR) and reached statistical significance with p<0.001. Other results are presented as mean (SD) for ordinal data, and as median for data which had expected peaks and descriptive data as raw percentages. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics Amos V 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, USA).
