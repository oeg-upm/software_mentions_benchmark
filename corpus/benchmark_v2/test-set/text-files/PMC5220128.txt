After 4 weeks of treatment, we killed the PDX mice and isolated the femur and tibia bone marrow cells in 4 − 7 mice of each experimental group. The bone marrow hCD45+ AML blasts at doses from 10 6 to 10 2 hCD45+ cells were transplanted into new recipient mice. After 18 − 22 weeks, cohorts of mice transplanted with dilutions of hCD45+ cells were screened for hCD45+ infiltration into the bone marrow of mouse femurs (for details please see reference 33 in Etchin et al. 40). The fractions of leukemic mice per total number of mice in each dilution cohort were used to calculate the LIC frequency by Extreme Limiting Dilution software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/ software/elda/). Please see Schmidt et al. 33 in the main text for details.
The fractions of mice that demonstrated hCD34+ engraftment per total number of animals in each dilution cohort were used to determine the HSC frequency by Extreme Limiting Dilution software. The following antibodies were used for flow cytometric analysis: hCD45, hCD33 (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), hCD34 and hCD38 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Percent and total hCD45+ cells in the bone marrow are presented as means ± s.e.m. Differences between experimental groups were determined with an unpaired Student's t-test. LIC and HSC frequencies were estimated from results of the secondary transplantation assays using Extreme Limiting Dilution software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/). 44
