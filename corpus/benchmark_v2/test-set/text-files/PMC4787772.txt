PCR products were analyzed on 6% acrylamide gels and Tif images were generated with the Biorad Geldoc 2000 (München, Germany) using default settings. PCR bands were quantified with the FusionCapt Advance software (Vilber Lourmat, Eberhardzell, Germany). The mean and standard deviation of replicated experiments were determined to obtain statistically reliable results.
In total, 18 NGS libraries were prepared, which were tagged by standard Illumina barcodes. The libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and demultiplexed by Illumina software (default parameters). For 8.52 % of the reads the barcode could not be identified unambiguously. These reads were excluded from further analysis. Another quality filtering step was imposed by our read-joining algorithm which requires that both reads of each read pair exhibit significant overlaps. 94.8% ± 1.81% of all read pairs could by joined successfully to one consensus sequence. Finally, the joined reads were classified and filtered again for occurrence of possible k1/k1 -boxes, which was the case for 90.6% ± 2.4%. In the end, compared to the original raw read numbers, on average 83.5% ± 2.2% of reads were used for the data analysis, which was equivalent to around 8.5 million read pairs.
