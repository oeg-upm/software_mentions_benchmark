In particular, previously unpublished data from 2010 suggests that food sharing may require social bonds that require development over long periods of time. In Trinidad, we captured 5 females at 5 sites that were 20-90 km apart. We conducted 3 separate food-sharing experiments to see if these previously unfamiliar individuals would begin sharing food after being kept in captivity together for several weeks. To assess changes in allogrooming over time, we also conducted random focal sampling of allogrooming. We ranked the amount of time each bat spent grooming others, then tested whether the mean ranks across bats increased over time using a permutation test (lmPerm package in R). We never observed food sharing, but we found that bats began begging others on the second and third sets of fasting trials on days 21 and 36 Table 1). We also found that allogrooming increased over time among the previously unfamiliar bats [R 2 = 0.45, F(1,10) = 8.3, p = 0.018].
