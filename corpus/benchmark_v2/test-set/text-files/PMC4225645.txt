Statistical analyses were performed with the aid ofSAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). All data are expressed as mean AE standard deviation (SD). The normality of data distribution was checked. Variables with skewed distributions were logtransformed prior to analysis. The significance of observed between-group differences was assessed using the unpaired Student t test and the significance of among-group differences was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). If a statistically significant effect was noted, Duncan's post-hoc test was applied to identify a between-group difference with a significance level of p < 0.05. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the extent of correlation between pairs of variables.
