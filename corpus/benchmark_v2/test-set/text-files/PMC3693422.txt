The MBS was analysed by using specific item numbers for 25(OH)D testing, bone densitometry (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry) and a commonly requested reference test, full blood count (FBC). The latter was used as a control for pathology test utilisation as it is unlikely to have been influenced by topical health trends. For individuals who had one to five tests, we used analysis of variance adjusting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni post hoc tests to determine whether there was a significant difference in the mean number of individuals being tested each year by quarter (not including duplicate tests) for each test frequency. All analyses were performed using SPSS V 19. Of the total number of tests, 54% of tests were initial tests and the remaining 46% of tests were subsequent tests, 25% of which were for the second test, 11% the third test and 6% the forth test. The remaining 6% of 25(OH)D tests were for between 5 and 79 tests in that period. Although we were able to distinguish between GP versus specialist, the data were not specific enough to determine if the same provider was performing each test.
