The results were presented as mean Â± standard errors (SE). Analysis was performed by SPSS for Windows 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests were performed to compare differences between various concentrations at each time point. For comparison of response to different concentrations at different times, repeated measure ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test was used. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
