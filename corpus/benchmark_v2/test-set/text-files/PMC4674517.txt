The outcome of the drug-related ED visit was categorized into three groups: (1) discharged immediately after consultation with the ED physician, (2) admitted to the ED-observation ward for a maximum of 72 h, and (3) admitted to a hospital ward through the ED. Drug classification was performed according to MIMS.com Malaysia version 1.3.0 [20].
Data were analyzed using statistical software (SPSS version 21, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The prevalence of ADE-related ED visits was calculated by dividing the number of patients with ADE-related ED visits by the total sample size. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic, clinical, and drug-related variables was conducted. Results were presented as frequency (percentage) for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation [SD]) for numerical variables. The Chi squared goodness-of-fit test was used to determine the distribution of cases in a single categorical variable at a 0.05 significance (alpha) level.
The ADE category with the highest prevalence rate in the current study was DTF, which accounted for more than one-half of ADE-related ED visits. This is consistent with a similar study conducted in a hospital ward in Malaysia [22]. In the current study, medication non-adherence was the major cause of DTF-related ED visits. The prevalence rate of DTF due to medication non-adherence reported was higher than that found in previous studies [8, 15, 42-44]. This variation may be due to more patients with chronic diseases visiting our ED with ADE-related complaints. However, patients with underlying chronic illness were found to have a higher chance of medication non-adherence [43]. Another reason for the higher prevalence rate of DTF due to medication non-adherence may be associatedwith the busy and overcrowded nature of some public hospitals in Malaysia, which may not allow adequate patient counseling, especially regarding medication adherence [45, 46]. Medication non-adherence has become a silent burden of healthcare [39, 44, 47]; thus, many intervention measures have been made to improve adherence to increase patient safety. Such interventions include patient education via verbal and written instructions, illustrations, and audiovisuals by healthcare providers, and reminders such as medication calendars, medication schedule alerts, stickers, box alarms, and pill timers. In Malaysia, efforts have been made to improve medication adherence, including the use of short message alerts, called MySMS Ã’ , in some hospitals [48] and the establishment of Medication Therapy Adherence Clinic (MTAC) services operated by pharmacists in some public hospitals. These services have resulted in significant improvements in medication adherence [49]. Studies have shown that pharmacist interventions have played a major role in improving medication adherence, especially among patients with chronic illness. The pharmacist is an expert on drugs and has the skills and expertise to improve medication adherence and potentially minimize the prevalence of DTF-related ED visits [50, 51]. More intervention measures are needed to improve medication adherence.
