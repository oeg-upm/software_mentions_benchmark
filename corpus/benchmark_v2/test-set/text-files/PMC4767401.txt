Exons and at least 50 nucleotides into the flanking intron sequences of AMT (GenBank NM_000481.2, NP_000472.2; Ensembl ENSG00000145020) and GLDC (GenBank NM_000170.2, NP_000161.2; Ensembl ENSG00000178445) were sequenced. Phase was established from parental samples. Deletions and duplications in GLDC were analyzed by either multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, 10 or by a targeted array-based comparative genomic hybridization utilizing a customized 60k oligonucleotide microarray with a positive threshold of 3 consecutive probes allowing the detection of 300bp deletions, and verified by dual real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taqman probes. Sequence variants were compared with 6 other species, and conservation was recorded. Splice site mutations were analyzed in silico using the BDGP Splice Site Prediction by Neural Network program, 21 and for select patients by analysis of mRNA in EBV transformed lymphoblasts. To evaluate the effect on splicing of a deep intronic mutation in AMT (Patient 75), the generated cDNA was sequenced in 2 overlapping fragments. To evaluate whether the maternal mutation c.2203-2A>G; IVS18-2A>G (Patient 310) created a leaky splicing error, we evaluated for the presence of normally spliced mRNA not containing the paternal mutation c.547delG in the mRNA of the patient and mother by digestion of the cDNA with NcoI followed by agarose electrophoresis, where the paternal mutation abolishes a restriction site.
The impact of each mutation on residual enzyme activity was systematically evaluated. Exonic deletions, nonsense mutations, and frameshift mutations were categorized as having no residual activity, except for a frameshift mutation that affected the final 20 amino acids. Splice site mutations affecting the 2 conserved donor or acceptor nucleotides and predicted in silico as likely affecting splicing were considered to leave no residual activity. For missense mutations in GLDC, the impact on residual P-protein activity was assessed by expression in vitro in COS cells and measuring the residual enzyme activity on a glycine exchange assay modified by the use of purified human recombinant lipoylated H-protein. 22 Missense mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into a full-length GLDC cDNA in the pCMV6-Entry vector (RC211292; Origine, Rockville, MD), and with mock and wild-type GLDC included in each experiment, were transfected into COS7 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were harvested after 48 hours, and P-protein activity was measured by the glycine exchange assay containing excess lipoylated, recombinant human H-protein. 22 Activities were normalized by protein concentration measured by the Bradford method 23 and mutant enzyme activity expressed as percentage of concurrent wild-type enzyme activity determined in the same experiment. Transfection efficiency was monitored by quantitative PCR for GLDC cDNA content. To generate recombinant, lipoylated human H-protein, GCSH cDNA PCR amplified from a human liver cDNA library was cloned as a thioredoxin fusion protein into the pBAD-DEST 49 vector (Life Technologies), expressed in bacteria, and purified from the cell lysate by boiling for 1 minute followed by chromatography on a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column. Lipoate-protein ligase (LplA) from Escherichia coli was expressed, purified, and used to lipoylate purified human H-protein as described using a molar ratio of 0.5:1.0 LplA:H-protein. 24 Lipoylation was confirmed by Western blotting (ab97625; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) and by mass spectrometry. The N-terminal thioredoxin tag was removed from the lipoylated H-protein by enterokinase digestion (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and reaction products were separated using a Q Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare BioSciences, Pittsburgh, PA). Following transfection in COS cells, steady state Pprotein levels were identified by Western blotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using an antibody against the P-protein from Abcam (ab97625), with b-actin as a loading control. Coexpression studies used cotransfection with vectors containing both mutants compared to transfection with a single mutation and an empty vector. A model of human P-protein encoded by the GLDC gene was created using the homology modeling program ESyPred3D based on the crystal structure of holo glycine decarboxylase from Synechocystis (Protein Data Bank ID: 4LHC). 25,26 The relative locations of mutated residues in the 3-dimensional model were viewed using the program RasTop 2.2 (http://www.genein- finity.org/rastop/).
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. The difference between severe and attenuated variables is evaluated by Student t test for variables that have normal distribution, and by Mann-Whitney U test for variables that are not normally distributed as evaluated with Wilk-Shapiro. Subcategories of attenuated NKH were evaluated by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance of a difference in proportion is calculated by the chi-square test. Pearson and Spearman correlation tests were conducted to identify the correlation between outcomes and predictors, and identify colinearity among the predictors according to the data distribution. Multiple linear regression was performed to model the DQ in relation to predictors. Multiple ordinal logistic regression was performed to model the relationship between predictors and disease severity or AEDs. SPSS Statistics package version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY) and SAS version 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC) were used to perform the analyses. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Table 1). Severe brain malformations (corpus callosum agenesis or cerebellar cyst with hydrocephalus) only occurred in patients with severe NKH or in neonatal death. Thus, 3 features related to clinical severity-developmental delay, number of AED, and brain malformation-interrelated as a class. We next examined clinical predictors of these severity classes.
