Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Experimental data were presented as mean Â± standard deviation and treated for statistics analysis by SPSS program. Comparison between groups was made using analysis of variance, and statistically significant difference was defined as P,0.05.showed that UM-UC-3 and J82 cells with higher DOCK1 are more resistant to cisplatin, whereas B87 cells with the lowest expression of DOCK1 exhibited the highest sensitivity to cisplatin. These results implied that DOCK1 may be involved in the chemoresistance to cisplatin in bladder cancer.
