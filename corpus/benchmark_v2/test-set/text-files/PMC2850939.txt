Mass spectrometric data was acquired on a Q-Tof2 TM (Micromass) hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight instrument. Mass spectra were recorded by linear scanning over a range of m/z 500-2500. Several scans were summed from a 4 µl introduction of sample solution (100 pmol µl −1 of sVSG121 glycan) in 80% acetonitrile containing 0.5 mM sodium actetate using type-F nanotips (Micromass). The data acquired were averaged and processed using the Mass-Lynx software supplied with the instrument. Positive ion spectra were recorded with a tip voltage of 1 kV and a cone voltage of 35-50 V. Fragment ion spectra from the doubly charged pseudomolecular ions were obtained by collision-induced fragmentation in the collision cell using argon as the collision gas at a pressure of 1 bar. The CID mass spectra were recorded by linear scanning over the m/z range 200-2200. Glu-fibrinopeptide B (Glu-fib) was used as an internal standard for mass calibration at 1 pmol µl −1 in 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid.Abbreviations CID, collision-induced dissociation; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ES, electrospray; GC-MS gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GPI-AP, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; HF hydrogen fluoride; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PMAAs, partially methylated alditol acetates; sVSG, soluble variant surface glycoprotein; T. brucei, Trypanosoma brucei.
