Image analysis (Supplementary material) was performed on a dedicated workstation (Apple Mac Pro Â® with OsiriX MD) by two treatment-blinded experienced image analysts. Baseline and follow-up MRV images were compared for each subject for the following venous segments: external iliac, common femoral, superficial femoral, deep femoral, popliteal, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, gastrocnemius, and peroneal veins.
For MRV images, analysts traced 3D curved multiplanar reconstructions, using contours following the centerline of each venous segment, and produced 1 mm axial slices perpendicular to the curved path. Analysts then manually segmented regions of interest corresponding to the thrombus. Thrombus volume was calculated by multiplying the area of interest (thrombus) by the slice thickness (1 mm) using a custom MATLAB (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA) script. Total thrombus volume in each subject was calculated by adding the thrombus volumes in each vessel.
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis set: all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of randomized study drug. The primary safety analysis (on-treatment) was performed using the safety analysis set: all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of randomized study drug according to the treatment actually received. Data analyses were performed using software SAS Version8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
