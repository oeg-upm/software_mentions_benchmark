Exercise tolerance test was done and revealed worsening degree of heart block with exercise confirming infra-nodal conduction disease. Patient met class I indication for PPM implantation, and decision was made to proceed with dual-chamber PPM insertion using CARTO mapping system (Biosense, Webster, Inc.) to avoid fluoroscopy exposure.
In summary, we present a rare case of dual-chamber PPM implantation in a pregnant woman, guided by EAM using CARTO system. The EAM system helped in creating 3D image of the heart and in guiding the pacemaker leads positioning. This case demonstrates the use of EAM system as a safe alternative to fluoroscopy in pregnant women requiring PPM insertion.
