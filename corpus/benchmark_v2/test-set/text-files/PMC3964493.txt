insulin resistance; factors included sex, presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and omentectomy randomization status. A two-sided P value , 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software v.17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). BMI, fat body mass, lean body mass, and blood pressure decreased at each follow-up time point compared with baseline. BMI, fat body mass, and lean body mass decreased compared with the previous visit at 6 and 12 months in post hoc analysis. Decreasing fat body mass and decreasing BMI were associated with increasing BNP at 12 and 24 months by linear mixed-effects model analysis (P 5 0.01 and P 5 0.02, respectively, at 12 months; and P 5 0.01 for both covariates at 24 months). BNP increased compared with baseline at follow-up time points 12 and 24 months (Fig. 1). NT-proBNP increased at 12 months but trended down at 24 months (Fig. 1). Omentectomy had no effect on BNP or HTN. Given recent data showing that natriuretic peptides contribute to the "browning" of fat tissue, resulting in increased energy expenditure (5), their role in blood pressure regulation, weight loss, and lipolysis in patients undergoing RYGB surgery invites further inquiry.served as the principal investigator for the original clinical research study from which samples were obtained, verified data, and reviewed and edited the manuscript. A.M.M. is the guarantor of this work and, as such, had full access to all the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
