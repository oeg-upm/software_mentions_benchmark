Data were presented as the mean Â± standard error of the mean (SEM) of three independent in vitro experiments. Statistical analysis and graphical representations were performed with SPSS 21.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) and Graph- Pad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The relations between clinical features and the PLCB1 expression were analyzed using chi-squared test and in vitro studies were evaluated with the Student's t-test. The KaplanMeier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and Cox regression model was applied to calculate univariate and multivariate hazard ratios for the study variables. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
