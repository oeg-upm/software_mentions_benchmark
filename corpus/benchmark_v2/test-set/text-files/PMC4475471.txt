Liver samples were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 4 µm, and processed routinely for H&E staining. Sirius Red, combined with morphometry, was used to quantify collagen using Bioquant image analysis software (Bioquant Image Analysis Corporation, Nashville, TN). Immunohistochemical staining of αSMA and desmin was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liver sections with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, England). A pathologist blindly scored 5 random areas per slide for necrosis, inflammation and dysplasia.
Genome-wide gene expression profiling of mouse primary hepatic stellate cells was performed, in triplicate, by using MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expression BeadChip (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Raw scanned data were normalized by using cubic spine algorithm implemented in the GenePattern genomic analysis toolkit (www.broadinstitute.org/genepattern) [19]. Probe-level expression data were collapsed into gene-level by calculating the median of multiple probes, and converted to human genes based on an orthologous mapping table provided by the Jackson laboratory (www.informatics.jax.org). The dataset (GSE#52253) is available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).
