The project E-VOICE (E-Voice … 2005) intends to concentrate on e-democracy/egovernment in order to try and renew the political information, communication and interaction processes between elected politicians, the administration and the citizensincluding young people -on a local and/or regional level at various locations in the North Sea Region with the support of the 'new' media (Internet, e-mail, sms, i-mode, etc.) in combination with the 'old' media (television, radio, (mobile) telephone, newspapers, etc). Some possible examples are: the organisational development of digital office hours -citizens get the opportunity to pose questions to mayor, aldermen and/ or council members by e-mail or by direct communication via the Internet and web-TV; online townhall (e.g. experimental broadcasts of the yearly local-council budgetary meeting); digital debates and online panel discussions for citizens; electronic neighbourhood groups (E-Voice … 2005).
As a result of the delegation of various functions to the local districts and the resulting increased focus on a flatter, less bureaucratic structure in relation to decision-making processes it became necessary to develop new methods for use in local government (INTELCITY 2002). Xie (2003) describes a complex online decision support system, WebPolis, in the context of eGovernment and eDemocracy. WebPolis is designed to facilitate greater community involvement in decision-making and offers a series of public communication and community application modules useful to local governments through a common online interface for users (both citizens and officials). WebPolis communication modules include e-mail, community newsletters, discussion conferences, online resources metadata harvesting and searching engine, and online surveys. WebPolis application toolsets contain Decision Action Process, Geographic Information Systems databases, landuse suitability analyst, infrastructure cost analyst, economic development analyst, and GASB34.
