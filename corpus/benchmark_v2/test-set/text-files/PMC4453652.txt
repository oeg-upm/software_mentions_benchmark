Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 12.1 (StataCorp 2012; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the cohort. Surgery was used as the denominator for all the analyses as there were 38 women who had undergone two separate procedures as part of their treatment (repeat surgeries for complications were excluded). In addition, it was possible that age, comorbidity and ASA grade could change over time in an individual woman. All eligible surgeries were included to calculate the crude or unadjusted Intra-op complication rate (CR) and for the Post-op CR analysis was limited to those with both hospitaland patient-reported data. To assess how each potential predictor affected the CR individually, univariable logistic regressions were performed separately for all predictors. For Intra-op complications, the independent variables included age, the presence of comorbidities (yes/no), type of comorbidities, BMI (continuous variable and categorical-underweight, normal, overweight, obese and morbidly obese), ASA grade (1-4), previous abdominal surgery (yes/no), grade of operating surgeon (consultant, sub-specialty trainee, general obstetrics and gynaecology trainee), surgical approach (laparotomy/laparoscopy), surgical complexity (1-5) and final diagnosis (ovarian, uterine, cervix, vulva and benign). For Post-op complications, two additional variables-duration of surgery (in hours) and EBL (o500 mls, 500-1000 mls, 41000-2500 mls, 42500 mls) were included.
