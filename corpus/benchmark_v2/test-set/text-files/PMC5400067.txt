The transcribed FGDs and interviews were thematically analysed using MAXQDA 2 software. A combined deductive and inductive approach was used for data analysis. The deductive analysis was based on the pre-identified themes focusing on the in-depth inquiry of the dimensions of care in the ICDM model. Inductive analysis was undertaken for an emerging theme that was not anticipated at the outset and not included among the 17 dimensions of care covered in the topic guide. The data were coded by S.A. and verified by the co-authors through the reading and re-reading of the quotes. A code book was developed based on recurring pre-identified themes and emerging themes. Reliability of the coded data was verified through discussions of inconsistent codes among co-authors until agreement was reached.
