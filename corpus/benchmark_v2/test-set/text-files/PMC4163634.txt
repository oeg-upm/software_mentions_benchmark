Quantitative SHAPE reactivity for individual datasets obtained with radiolabeled primers was normalized to a scale spanning 0-1.5, in which 0 indicates unreactive nucleotides and the mean intensity at highly reactive nucleotides is set to 1.0 [3]. For each dataset, the intensity of the untreated RNA was subtracted from that of the treated RNA to obtain the net reactivity. Then, a normalization factor was determined by excluding the 2% most-reactive peak intensities, followed by calculating the mean for the next 8% of peak intensities. Reactivity values were then divided by this mean [58]. Data from at least three independent assays were used to calculate the SHAPE reactivity (mean AE SD). SHAPE electropherograms were analyzed using QUSHAPE software [59]. Quantitative SHAPE reactivities for individual datasets were normalized to a scale spanning 0-1.5, in which 0 indicates an unreactive nucleotide, and the mean intensity at highly reactive nucleotides is set to 1.0.
The secondary RNA structure was visualized using VAR- NA [61]. RNAsc, RNAstructure and SHAPEKNOTS software [49-51] were used to predict the secondary RNA structure including SHAPE reactivity values.
Alignment of 180 FMDV IRES nucleotide sequences available in GenBank was performed using CLUSTALX with default parameters (http://www.clustal.org). Polymorphic positions in the region 306-380 were determined relative to the FMDV C-S8 isolate (GenBank accession number AF274010.1). The sequence logo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu) was generated from alignment of the 180 IRES sequences. The overall height of each stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position (measured in bits), and the height of symbols within the stack reflects the relative frequency of the corresponding nucleic acid at that position.
