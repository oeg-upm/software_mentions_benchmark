We calculated 95% cis for the POr using the maximum likelihood odds ratio with mid-P using Statcalc in epi info 7 and for irr based on the Poisson distribution indicated in the geigy scientific tables. 23 although the second round of screening that began in the 2014 fiscal year was not included in the tables, the numbers of subjects were as follows: total subjects, 218,397; actually screened, 106,068 (49%); among them, for 75,311 (71%), it had already been decided whether the secondary examination was necessary or not; positives in the screening, 611 (0.8%); examined in the secondary examination, 377 (62% of the positives); finally diagnosed by the secondary examination, 262 (70%); examined by fine needle aspiration, 22 (8%), and detected eight new thyroid cancer cases by cytology up to December 31, 2014. all of the eight cancer cases (four males and four females with ages at the accident ranging from 6 to 17 years at the time of the accident in 2011) underwent the first round screening. in three among the eight cases, a ≤5.0-mm nodule and/or a ≤20.0-mm cyst were detected in the first round. the one cancer case was already operated on (histological type was papillary carcinoma). Mean age of the cases in 2011 was 12.1 ± 3.4 years in the second round, whereas it was 14.8 ± 2.6 years in the first round. even under the assumption that the remaining 75,303 (75,311 minus 8 cancer cases) are disease free, an excess irr for external comparison with 3 years as a latent duration which was maximum time since the first round was observed (12, 95% ci = 5.1, 23).
