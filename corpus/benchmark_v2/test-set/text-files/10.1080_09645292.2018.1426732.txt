is the log-odds that child i in household j in commune k is attending school. b 0 is the intercept shared by all individuals, households and communes. m k is the effect of commune k, w jk . The effect of household j and 1 ijk is the child level residual error. The models here are computedsing second-order penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL2) in MLwiN (Rasbash et al. 2015) via the Stata module runmlwin (Leckie and Charlton 2013). When selecting the appropriate means by which to estimate multilevel equations, it is necessary to choose a method at is both the most unbiased, but also computationally feasible. Simulations in Rodriguez and Goldman (2001) show that 2nd order Penalised Quasi Likelihood (PQL) estimation provided the closest approximation to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), out of the choice of 1st and 2nd order marginal quasi-likelihood (MQL) and 1st and 2nd order PQL. Whilst, ideally, MLE would be used to obtain all the estimates, this is computationally very intensive for models beyond the null; Stata's commands such as xtmelogit often take many hours or days to converge, if at all. Appendix B displays estimates of the variance of the random effects in equation (3) using MQL1, MQL2, PQL1, PQL2 and MLE; Whilst there is still a downward bias in the estimates of s 2 m and s 2 w compared to MLE, PQL2 performs substantially better than the other quasi-likelihood estimators. Given that MLE estimates for models beyond the null are computationally very difficult to obtain, PQL2 is the preferred method here.
