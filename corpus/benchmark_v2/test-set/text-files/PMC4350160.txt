In this study, twenty-five patients candidate for elective or emergent open bone fixation of the forearm, carpus and/or hand referred to Hazrat Rasul Hospital, Tehran, Iran, were recruited. The operation should be performed in 90 minutes. Exclusion criteria were patients' refusal to undergo the experiment, history of allergy to local anesthetics, presence of severe heart disease, severe hypotension, seizure, drug addiction, psychiatric diseases, use of antidepressants or anxiolytics, multiple trauma or other organs' involvement and underlying disease in which tourniquet application is contraindicated (such as the Raymond's disease and sickle cell disease or trait). The study received ethics committee approval from Iran University of Medical Sciences. All participants were informed about the type and method of anesthesia and pain measurement individually by the anesthesiologist and written informed consent was obtained from them. To overcome some of traditional method's disadvantages, two changes were made as: 1) The IV cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein; 2) an elastic band was firmly wrapped around the proximal forearm distal to the cannulation site. Lidocaine 0.5% (at least 4 mg/kg totally in 50 mL) (1, 3, 4) was carefully administered via the IV cannula in less than 90 seconds. The forearm was held perpendicular to the elbow, above the local anesthetic injection site, for five minutes. Then it was fastened with the elastic band distal to the cannulation site to keep the anesthetic agent in the proximal arm and prevent its distal spread. Tourniquet pressure and other details were the same as the traditional method. If pain was present at the tourniquet site, the distal tourniquet would be first inflated and the proximal one deflated. At the end of operation, the tourniquet was totally deflated. The pain was measured and recorded based on the standard verbal descriptive scale of 0-5 scores, presented in Table 1 (13). Data including pain at surgical site before the operation, five minutes after the block, every five minutes during the operation, before and after tourniquet entire deflation and then every ten minutes until one hour after the tourniquet deflation were recorded. For each patient pain at the tourniquet site was measured at ten minutes intervals separately after inflating the proximal tourniquet, after inflating the distal tourniquet and after deflating the proximal one throughout the operation. Anatomic site of upper extremity bone undergoing the operation was lower forearm and hand, distal radius or ulna, carpus, metacarpus and phalanges. The type of bone surgery consisted of drilling in association with applying pins, plates and screws. The operation length was individually recorded for each patient. Prior to the operation, an 18-gauge intravenous cannula was inserted on the contra lateral limb for fluid administration. Shortly after the cannula insertion, 1 µg/kg fentanyl and 0.015 µg/kg midazolam were administered for all patients. The tourniquet was carefully deflated following bone fixation to obtain surgical site hemostasis. Considering the side effects of local anesthetic toxicity, patients were evaluated during the operation as well as the first hour of operation (1, 4, 9). All patients with mild pain (< 1 on the pain score) following tourniquet deflation received an extra dose of fentanyl (1-1.5 µg/kg). The protocol was to induce general anesthesia if intolerable pain was experienced or if the operation took longer than 90 minutes. Throughout the first 24 hours of the operation, the site of operation was checked for thrombophlebitis, Volkmann ischemic paralysis and cellulitis every four hours and every 12 hours during the next 48 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13 for windows. The quantitative data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), while the qualitative data as frequency.
