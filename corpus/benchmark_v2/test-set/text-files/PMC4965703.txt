Recordings were transcribed, de-identified, checked for accuracy, and analyzed using a general inductive approach to identify themes. The purpose of using an inductive approach is to derive themes organically from raw data, rather than using a priori hypotheses to predict outcomes. 26 As transcripts became available, 2 investigators (CG and MH) conducted detailed readings of the transcripts to identify emergent themes. The analysis team discussed and refined these themes as a group. Thematic saturation occurred after reviewing and discussing 20 interviews. The themes identified were used to generate and define inductive codes. The transcripts were then imported into the qualitative analysis software NVivo 10 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia), after which the 2 investigators independently coded the transcripts, with meetings to resolve discrepancies and reach consensus on preliminary and final codes. The researchers then identified the overarching theme of characteristics and role of relationships in care management.
