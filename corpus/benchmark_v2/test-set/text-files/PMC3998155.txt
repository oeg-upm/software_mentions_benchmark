The software STATA, version 11.2, was used to perform the statistical analysis on a cross-sectional basis. Student's t-test was used to assess differences between mean values and the z-test was used to assess differences between proportions. Severe SPAP and mPAP were defined as the 4 th quartile in both cases (≥ 120 mmHg and ≥ 76 mmHg for SPAP and mPAP, respectively). The relationship between echocardiography-derived SPAP and invasive mPAP was assessed by Pearson's correlation. Percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient for severe classification of SPAP and mPAP were also computed.
