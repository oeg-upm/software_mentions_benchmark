For co-crystallization, 1 mM MAX purified protein was mixed with 0.5 mM double-stranded oligonucleotide with nine different DNAs (Supplementary Figure S2). The best diffracting crystal used for data collection was obtained from 5 -AGTAGCAXGTGCTACT-3 (where X = 5caC) (synthesized by New England Biolabs). Crystals appeared within 1-day under the conditions of 0.1 M sodium citratecitric acid at pH 5.5, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3000. Crystals were cryoprotected by soaking in mother liquor supplemented with 30% ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction datasets were collected at the SER-CAT beamline (22ID-D) at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory and processed using XDS (40). The structure was solved by molecular replacement by PHENIX (41,42) using the Max-DNA complex structure (PDB 1AN2 (43)) as a search model. PHENIX refinement scripts were used for refinement, and the statistics shown in Supplementary Table S1 were calculated for the entire resolution range.
The CoMMpass (Clinical outcomes in Multiple Myeloma to personal assessment) database interim analysis IA9 was interrogated for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants in the MAX locus (https://research. themmrf.org). RNA-seq data and overall survival data were extracted for those patients harboring MAX variants and compared to those for whom MAX status could be definitively called but whom lacked MAX SNVs (wildtype). Overall survival data between the two groups were compared using a Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Hazard Ratio determined using the Mantel-Haenszel test in GraphPad Prism 6.0. MYC expression levels were determined from RNAseq data that was processed with Cufflinks by the CoMMpass consortium and expressed as FPKM--fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped. The distributions between the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test implemented inGraphPad Prism 6.0.
