Subjects reported to the laboratory and their height, weight and total body fat were measured using a portable stadiometer and body composition analyzer (BC-418, Tanita, Japan), respectively. Then the subjects completed a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO 2 max). VO 2 max was measured on a motor-driven treadmill (Run race, Techno gym, Italy), using an indirect calorimetry system (Quark b2, Cosmed, Italy) with an incremental exercise test to volitional fatigue. To estimate average energy and nutritional intake, soccer players recorded their dietary intake during 4 consecutive days. The energy, macronutrient and micronutrient intakes were calculated using CRON-O-Meter v0.9.6. software.
Data were inspected for normal distribution using the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM for normally distributed variables. When the distribution differed from normal, geometric means and 95% confidence intervals were given. Hematological and biochemical parameters were analyzed using the ANOVA repeated-measures general linear model. Non-normally distributed data were transformed logarithmically, before statistical comparisons were made. Spearman's non-parametric correlation analysis was used to assess univariate associations between studied variables. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using the PASW Statistics version 18.0 and MedCalc (version 11.4 Software, Belgium) software.
