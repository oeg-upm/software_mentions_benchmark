Patients who provided consent attended an orientation to the SMART Project during a regularly scheduled clinic appointment. Informed assent and parental consent were obtained, participants were oriented to the SMART Project, and adolescents completed a demographics and medical history questionnaire. Participants were registered in the SMART Project program, a two-way text message software program contracted through Reify Health of Baltimore, Md., and the timing of texts was customized according to their schedules. Participants were instructed to choose morning (before school), afternoon (after school), evening (before bed), and weekend mid-morning times. Glucose meters were downloaded, and medical charts were reviewed for A1C results. Participants were compensated with a $25 gift card.
Text message data. Participants' responses to SMART Project text messages were collected via the Reify Health software program, and the time and verbatim text of text messages were downloaded. From these data, response rates and response latency were calculated. Overall and weekly response rates were calculated as the percentage of texts to which an adolescent responded. For Weeks 1 and 6, adolescents were supposed to text their blood glucose levels three times per day (morning, afternoon, and evening); thus, the denominator in the Week 1 and Week 6 equations was 21 (3 times per day × 7 days). For Weeks 2-5, adolescents were supposed to respond to two texts per day (morning and either afternoon or evening); thus, the denominator in the equations for Weeks 2-5 was 14 (2 times per day × 7 days). Finally, the denominator for the overall Week 1-Week 6 response rate was 98 (the sum of texts they were asked to send each week). Response latency was calculated as the number of minutes before the adolescent responded.
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20th ed. (International Business Machines, Armonk, N.Y.). Descriptive statistics were generated to assess adolescents' demographic and medical characteristics and their SMART Project text message response rate and latency by week and time of day. Correlational analyses were conducted to determine whether adolescents' demographic and medical characteristics were related to their text message response rates.
