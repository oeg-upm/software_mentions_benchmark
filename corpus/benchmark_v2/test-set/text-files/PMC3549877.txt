Data were normalized using GenomeStudio V2010.3 (Illumina). The DNA methylation level is displayed as β-values ranging from 0 to 1. Methylation level (β-value) for each of the 485,577 CpG sites were calculated as the ratio of methylated signal divided by the sum of methylated and unmethylated signals this stage, these results might inspire further studies involving targeted sequencing of the MYB gene locus.

After normalization step, probes related to X and Y chromosomes were removed as well as those containing a SNPs with a frequency > 1% (Caucasian population; 1000 Genome project) in the probe sequence or interrogated CpG site. Samples were clustered by hierarchical clustering using Manhattan distances. Transcription factor binding enrichment. Transcription factor enrichment analysis was performed using PSCAN. 18 Transcription factor binding annotations were extracted from TRANSFAC. The gene promoter region was defined as -1,000 and +0 bp to the transcription start site. Z-test p values were corrected for multiple hypotheses testing using the Bonferroni method.
