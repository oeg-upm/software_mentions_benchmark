Image accusation was performed essentially as described in Meaburn et al. (2009). Briefly, tissue sections were imaged with an IX70 (Olympus, Waltham, MA) DeltaVision (Applied Precision-GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) system, using a 60×/1.42 numerical aperture oil objective lens (Olympus) and an auxiliary magnification of 1.5. Image stacks were acquired with a 0.5-μm step interval along the z-axis. If mixed morphologies were present in a tissue section, before imaging, the tissue was visually inspected at low resolution (10× lens; Olympus) to identify malignant, normal, or hyperplastic regions. In these cases, hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue slides that had been marked by a pathologist (L.D.T.) were used as a guide to ensure correct classification of different regions of a tissue. Image stacks were deconvolved and converted into maximum intensity projections using SoftWoRx (Applied Precision). Image analysis was performed as previously described (Meaburn et al., 2009). Images were contrast enhanced based on visual inspection, and individual nuclei were manually delineated in Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA), with each nucleus saved in a separate image file. To determine the relative radial positioning of a gene in a given tissue, 91-263 randomly selected interphase epithelial nuclei were run though a custom-made image analysis software package (P. Gudla and S. Lockett, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; Meaburn et al., 2009) in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) using the PRTools and DIPImage toolboxes (Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands). The software automatically identified FISH Harewood et al., 2010). Of interest, FLI1 and MMP9 also reposition in breast cancer (unpublished data), suggesting that they are multitissue markers of cancer. Not all genes that reposition in cancer are general markers of a malignant state, however, since an additional eight genes that reposition in breast cancer (Meaburn et al., 2009) do not reposition in prostate cancer (unpublished data).
