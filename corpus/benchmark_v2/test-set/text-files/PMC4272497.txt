For statistical analysis of the data obtained was used software package SPSS for Windows. In the analysis of the results obtained, the following statistical methods were used: for continuous variables in the study as the first analysis of symmetry (normality) of their distribution by Kolmogornov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk test. Since the distribution of continuous variables significantly deviated from normal (Gaussian) distribution, mean values and a measure of dispersion, for their comparison is used the median and interquartile range and nonparametric test (ANOVA), normal and ordinal variables in the study were analyzed by χ2 test and in the lack of expected frequencies used Fisher's exact test. The statistical analysis used the Pearson χ2 test for difference distribution of nominal and ordinal data. Table 1 shows the frequency of dysplasia (L-Sil and H-SIL) in relation to the normal cytological findings.
