Finally, we used multivariate logistic regression to examine the combined effects of household income, diet intakes, and PA on overweight and obesity. Four models were performed by consecutively including predictors of overweight and obesity. Firstly, we included household income and year (Model 1). Subsequently, dietary energy intake was added (Model 2). Next moderate and vigorous PA was also included (Model 3). Sedentary activity was finally included (Model 4). To interpret odds ratios (ORs), we simulated the predicted prevalence of overweight and obesity if all subjects had the diet and PA profiles of the low-, medium-, or high-income levels in 1997 and 2009. Although the CHNS is longitudinal in nature, the present study focused on cross-sectional analysis of data in 1997 and 2009. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (Version 9; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
