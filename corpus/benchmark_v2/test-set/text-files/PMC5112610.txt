Bioinformatics analysis. Protein structures of the TTLL12 wildtype and new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform were predicted by bioinformatics softwares. The mRNA CDS and AA sequence of wild-type TTLL12 were gained in NCBI (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/blast). In addition, the new transcript of TTLL12 was translated into a new AA sequence using DNAStar EditSeq. Then, the AA sequence of the new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was aligned with the wild-type by NCBI protein blast (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Physicochemical properties of the wild-type and new isoform were predicted by online tools ProtParam and ProtScale (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/ protscale.html), respectively. Secondary structures of the wild-type and new isoform AA sequences were predicted by DNAStar Protean and online tool CFSSP (http://www.biogem. org/tool/chou-fasman/). To further investigate the function of the new isoform of the TTLL12 transcript, we also used the online prediction tool DisPort search (http://www.disport.org/ search.php) to predict whether the additional 36 AA sequence is in a disordered region of TTLL12.
Physicochemical properties of the TTLL12 wild-type and new 36AA plus isoform. The AA sequence of the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was obtained using DNAStar EditSeq and translating the DNA sequences. Then, the AA sequence of the new isoform was aligned with the TTLL12 wild-type, and we found an additional 36AA inserted at the location of 281AA of the TTLL12 wild-type (Fig. 5A). Next, we predicted the physicochemical properties by ProtParam and ProtScale. The properties of TTLL12 wild-type and 36AA plus isoform AA sequences were predicted (Table I) as follows: the total number of negatively charged residues (Asp + Glu) was 93 and 96; and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAvY) was -0.390 and -0.338. In addition, the total hydropathicities of the two types of TTLL12 proteins are displayed in diagram (Fig. 5B and C). These results suggest that the two types of TTLL12 proteins are hydropathical molecules, and the 36AA plus isoform is more stable than the wild-type.
The additional 36AA is involved in a disordered region of TTLL12. To ascertain whether the additional 36AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform is in a disordered region of TTLL12, we firstly sought the disordered regions of the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform by the opening accessible online resources DisProt search, and found that the peptide of 260AA to 299AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was highly identical to the disordered region of Bcl-2-like protein 11 (B2L11) (Fig. 7A), suggesting this peptide could act as a disordered region in the Figure 5. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the TTLL12 wild-type and new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform. The amino acid sequence of the new TTLL12 36AA plus isoform was aligned with the TTLL12 wild-type by NCBI protein blast, and an additional 36 amino acid sequence was found (A). Hydropathicity of the wild-type (B) and the new 36AA plus isoform (C, red box indicates the inserted 36AA peptide) of TTLL12 was predicted by ProtParam and ProtScale, respectively. TTLL12 36AA plus isoform. As the additional 36AA are located between 281AA and 282AA in the TTLL12 36AA plus isoform, we further explored whether the additional 36AA was in the disordered region of the protein. using DisProt search, we found that the additional 36AA was partly identical to the disordered region of brain natriuretic peptide-32 (BNP-32) (Fig. 7B), giving the possibility that the 36AA could endow TTLL12 with new functions by acting as part of the disordered region. However, the biological functions of the new TTLL12 isoform in cancers remain to be further investigated.
