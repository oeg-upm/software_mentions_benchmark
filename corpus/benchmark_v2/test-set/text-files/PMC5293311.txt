The aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the quality of life in women who underwent breast reconstruction with implants with those who underwent free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap breast reconstruction, using BREAST-Q 11 to appraise patient-reported outcomes.
A cross-sectional study design was used. Recruitment of patients was based on electronic medical records analysis. Afterward description of the study and a BREAST-Q breast reconstruction postoperative questionnaire were sent to both groups of patients (50 letters for each group). The questionnaire booklet was mailed along with a selfaddressed, postage-paid return envelope according to the type of reconstruction. The questionnaires were marked with different colors to differentiate between implant breast reconstruction and autologous breast reconstruction. We received responses from 34 patients who underwent implant breast reconstruction and 31 patients who underwent free TRAM flap reconstruction, giving a total of 65 patients.
The BREAST-Q (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the University of British Columbia, 2006, all rights reserved) is a patient-reported outcome measure that was specifically designed to measure the quality of life and patient satisfaction among breast surgery patients. 11 The instrument was developed and validated with adherence to guidelines set by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Medical Outcomes Trust (2002) and the US Food and Drug Administration. 12-15 The BREAST-Q reconstruction module was used as the primary outcome measure in this study.
The scales forming the BREAST-Q reconstruction module are as follows: satisfaction with breasts, satisfaction with the overall outcome, psychosocial well-being, sexual well-being, physical well-being of the chest, satisfaction with nipple areola reconstruction, satisfaction with information, satisfaction with the surgeon, satisfaction with the medical team, and satisfaction with the office staff.
The patients' responses to each scale's items were analyzed through the Q Score that analyses data based on RUMM 2020, a data-analyzing program developed byRasch Unidimensional Measurement Models Laboratory. This software automatically transforms raw data into summary scores that range from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 100 (very satisfied) for each scale. For all BREAST-Q scales, a higher score indicates greater satisfaction or better quality of life. A mean change of 5 to 10 on a multi-item scale is perceived as "a little" change, 10 to 20 as "a moderate" change, and greater than 20 as "a maximal" change.
Before commencing the study, the questionnaire had a Czech translation validated in accordance with the agreement with the MAPI Trust (http:// www.mapi-trust.org/). The translated version was approved by Andrea Pusic, the author of the BREAST-Q.
The obtained data were reported in Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash.) and were analyzed using SAS statistical software package version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C.). Data are expressed as the mean and SD. Comparisons between breast reconstruction with implants and breast reconstruction with autologous tissues were made using a paired sample t test. Significance was considered at P < 0.01.
