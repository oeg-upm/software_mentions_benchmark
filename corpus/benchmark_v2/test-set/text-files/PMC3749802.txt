The Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles bearing TMZ was prepared using emulsification solvent evaporation method technique reported by Avgoustakis, (2004). The various process and formulation variable, i.e., drug concentration, polymer concentration, PVA concentration and sonication time were optimized to get small sized nanoparticles with maximum percent drug entrapment. These variables were optimized by applying 3 4 factorial design using Design Expert Software.
In this method of optimization, it is difficult to develop an optimized formulation as the method reveals nothing about the interaction among the variables. The independent variable selected were, concentration of drug (A), concentration of PLGA/ PEG-PLGA (B), PVA concentration in aqueous phase (C) and sonication time (D). Hence, a 3 4 factorial design was used with 4 factors (A, B, C and D) at 3 levels and experimental trials were performed at all 82 possible combinations which reveals that onThe main effect of A, B, C and D represents the average result of changing variable at a time from its low level to high level. The interaction terms (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, A 2 , B 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) show how the PDE changes when 2 variables are simultaneously changed. The negative coefficient for all the independent variables (D, AC, BD, A 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) indicate unfavorable effect on the PDE while others are exhibiting positive interaction which indicate favorable effect on the PDE as its concentration in all selected formulation is kept unchanged. Among the four independent variables the lowest coefficient value is for D (−0.36 and p < 0.05) indicating that this variable is insignificant in the prediction of PDE. It is also observed that the PDE does not significantly change (p < 0.05) because as on changing sonication time from 30 sec to 90 sec there is very little decrease in the PDE which shows very less amount of drug loss due to size reduction of the nanoparticles. Similarly, the effect of PVA on the PDE of various nanoparticles was observed and as on increasing the PVA concentration from 0.5 to 1% in nanoparticles the PDE increases significantly while on further increasing PVA concentration of PEGylation of nanoparticles. The PDE (dependent variable) obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and D). The response surface quadratic models were generated usingExpert Design Software. These were subjected to multiple regression to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated which are found to be > 0.94 indicating good fit. The PDE values measured for various batches showed wide variation i.e., ranges from a minimum of 52.89% to a maximum of 77.96% in case of temozolomide bearing Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while a minimum of 49.62% to a maximum of 75.91% in case temozolomide bearing PEGylated nanoparticles. It is clearly indicated that the PDE is strongly affected by the variables selected for the study. It is observed that as on increasing the concentration of PLGA polymer in the matrix of nanoparticles the percent drug entrapment was found to increased up to the level of medium (i.e., 50 mg) at 5 mg of drug concentration then very little change in PDE was observed which could be due to completely entrapment of the drug into the polymer matrix.is desirable. In our case the Adeq-Precision value is in range of 26-28 which indicates an adequate signal (Tables 5 and 6). Particle size. Nanoparticles are formed when specific concentration of PLGA and PVA were mixed together. All the batches of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles within the experimental design were also evaluated for their particle size. The transformed values for particle size of all the batches (28 each) of Non-PEGylated and PEGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomide TMZ along with the results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The results show that formulations no. 10, 19, 20 and 22 from each class of formulations are exhibiting minimum particle size, i.e., < 114 nm for Non-PEGylated nanoparticles, while it is increased about 6 nm more in case of PEGylation of nanoparticles which might be due to the diffusion of the copolymer solubilized in the organic phase leads to an homogenous distribution of the PEG chain on the surface of the droplets and on the surface of the NPs after solvent evaporation. The PS (dependent variable) obtained at various levels of 4 independent variables (A, B, C and D). The response surface quadratic models were generated using Expert Design Software. These were subjected to multiple regression to yield a second order polynomial equations (full model). The correlation coefficient for the models were also calculated which are found to be > 0.96 indicating good fit. The particle size of various nanoparticles formulations showed wide variation i.e., ranges from a minimum of 111.91 nm to a maximum of 120.88 no significant change in PDE was observed in all the cases of nanoparticles formulations. This shows an appropriate concentration of PVA (surfactant 1%) for the better formation of emulsion. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) measures how much the variance of that model coefficient is inflated by the lack of orthogonality in the design and calculated for Non-PEGylated and PEGylated formulations for temozolomide which is found to be near 1 indicating good estimation of the coefficient (Tables 3 and 4). Similarly Ri-squared is near to zero which is leading to good model. The model F value calculated in the range of 75.15 to 81.00 which implies the models are significant. The values of Prob > F less than 0.05 are indicating that model terms are significant. In all cases A, B, C, D, AB, A 2 and B 2 are significant model terms. The lack of fit values "F-value" for Non-PEGylated nanoparticles was found to be 61.86, which implies the lack of fit is not significant relative to the pure error and there are only 10-11% chances of large lack of fit "F-value" which could occur due to noise and non-significant lack of fit "F-value" is good fit of model. Similar results were obtained in PEGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomide where lack of fit "F-value" was found to be 11.44% which is non-significant related to pure error. In both these cases 17-23% chances of large lack of fit "F-value" could occur due to noise. In both cases "Pred R-squared" values are in reasonable agreement with the "Adj R-squared" values. The AdeqPrecision is the measures of the signal to noise ratio. A ratio > 4 Table 3. Design matrix evaluation for response surface quadratic model of non-peGylated nanoparticles bearing temozolomideThe main effect of A, B, C and D represent the average result of changing variable at a time from its low level to high level. The interaction terms (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, A 2 , B 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) show how the particle size changes when 2 variables are simultaneously changed. The negative coefficient for all the independent variables (D, AB, BC, BD, A 2 , B 2 , C 2 and D 2 ) indicate unfavorable effect on the particle size while others are exhibiting positive interaction which indicate favorable effect on the nanoparticles size. Among the 4 independent variable the lowest coefficient value is for D 2 (−0.02 and p < 0.05) indicating that this variable is insignificant in the prediction of PS as the concentration of drug was kept unchanged. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) measures how much the variance of that model coefficient is inflated by the lack of orthogonality in the design and calculated for NonPEGylated and PEGylated formulations which is found to be near 1 indicating good estimation of the coefficient.
