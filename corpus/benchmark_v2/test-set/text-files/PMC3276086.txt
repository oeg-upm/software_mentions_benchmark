DNase-treated RNA (5 lg) was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 50 ll using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer Express (v3.0, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (primers 5-30, Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). Quantitative reverse transcription PCRs (qRT-PCRs) were performed using 20 ng of cDNA and 300 nM of each primer in a 20 ll reaction volume with SYBR GREEN PCR MasterMix (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). Three biological and three technical replicates for each reaction were analysed on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) with a first step of 95°C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min. Melting curves were generated using the following program: 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 95°C for 15 s. Transcript abundance was quantified using standard curves for both target and reference genes, which were generated from serial dilutions of PCR products from corresponding cDNAs. Transcript abundance was normalized to the reference genes [PsAct (EF585293) and AtAct (NM_121018)] that show high stability across the different treatments.
