Crystal diffraction data of apo-ACP and FabZ-ACP complex were collected at beamline BL19U1 at the National Center for Protein Sciences Shanghai and Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, China. Significant decay of the complex crystals during data collection caused the resolution cut off at 2.55 Å. While the crystal diffraction data of holo-ACP were collected at 100 K using CuKα X-ray with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ image plate. The data were further processed using HKL2000 software package [47] and CrystalClear software. The structures were solved by MR with the published structure of apo-EcACP (PDB code: 1T8K) and HpFabZ (PDB code: 2GLL) as search models, and refined by using programs Phenix [48] (complex) and CNS (apo and holo-ACP). The crystallographic statistics are summarized in Supplementary information, Table S1. Electron density interpretation and model building were performed using the computer graphics program Coot [49]. Final structures were visualized by PyMol software.
SYBYL package (www.tripos.com) was used to prepare the fatty acid chains and the protein structures used in docking. Initial structures of fatty acid chains in different lengths (4-to 16-carbon chain) were sketched using the SYBYL program with standard geometric parameters, and Gasteiger-Hucker charge was added. All fatty acids were then optimized using the standard TRIPOS force field with Gasteiger-Hückel charges until the energy gradient converged to below 0.05 kcal/mol. Waters in the crystal structure of FabZ were removed, and all hydrogens were added. Kollman all-atom charges were assigned for FabZ and Gasteiger-Hückel charge was computed for residue 36 with 4′-Pan-arm.
Genetic algorithm-based docking program GOLD was used for molecular docking simulations [50]. Fatty acid chain-binding site for docking was defined as a collection of all atoms within 25 Å around the midpoint of the terminal S of the 4-Pan-arm and O atom of Lys97, so the active site would be big enough to include the possible binding sites of variable length fatty acid chains. The GOLDScore fitness function was employed in scoring conformations. The parameters for GOLD were as follows: numbers of GA ran 50, no early termination was allowed and all other parameters were used as default (Supplementary information, Table S3).
FabZ-ACP complex purified from gel-filtration in the solution containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM DTT was used in the Synchrotron SAXS experiment. The measurement was performed in a vacuum cuvette with exposure time of 1 s to diminish the parasitic scattering under wavelength 1.03 Å at National Center for Protein Sciences Shanghai (NCPSS) beamline BL19U2, China. The scattering was recorded in the range of the momentum transfer 0.015 < s < 0.420/Å, where s = (4π × sinθ)/λ and 2θ is the scattering angle. SAXS data were subsequently processed and analyzed by using the ATSAS program suite [51]. Briefly, program PRIMUS [52] was employed to process the experimental scattering data and correct the solvent background scattering. Program CRYSOL was used to generate the theoretical scattering from the FabZ-ACP complex crystal structure [53]. Program GNOM was employed to calculate the distance distribution function p(r) (Figure 5C and 5D) [54]. Subsequently, programsDAMMIN [55], GASBOR [56] and DAMAVER [57] were used to reconstruct the low-resolution shapes to a dummy atom particle model, and superpose to the crystal structure (Figure 5E). The figure was generated by using GraphPad Prism 5 and PyMol software.
MST assay is a new immobilization-free and titration-based technology for biomolecule interaction determination [58]. The assay was performed with a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH). Briefly, FabZ or FabZ (Y100A) was labeled with fluorescence dye NT-647 (amine-reaction) according to manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, 50 nM of labeled protein was mixed with various concentrations of holo-ACP in the reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM fresh DTT and 0.05% Tween 20. After incubation for 5 min under room temperature, 10 µl of the mixtures were loaded into premium coated capillaries for measurement. The MST data were then collected under 40% infrared laser power and 20% light-emitting diode power. Nanotemper analysis software (1.5.41) was used to fit the independent experimental data and determine Kd and standard deviation value. The figure was generated by using GraphPad Prism 5.
