All percentages are reported, including 95% confi dence intervals (CIs). Continuous data are reported as median and interquartile ranges (due to skewing of the data). Comparisons of categorical data were done using chi-squared test. Comparisons of re-admission rates were done on a per-procedure basis, regardless of whether patients had multiple re-admissions. However, evaluation of specifi c complications of interest included all cases with LOS of > 4 days or re-admission. For multiple logistic regression analysis, we included variables previously found to infl uence outcome after fast-track THA and TKA (use of walking aids, preoperative anemia etc.) or related to increased BMI (hypertension, diabetes etc.). The model included 11 variables, with hospital of surgery added as a random effect. Analyses were done with SPSS version 20. 95% CI values for percentages were calculated at http://vassarstats.net/. Any p-value of < 0.05 was considered signifi cant.
