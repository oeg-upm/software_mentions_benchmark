Image manipulations were performed using the "Dr. View", version 5.2 medical image processing application package (AJS Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined over the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices, head of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and cerebellum with reference to a coregistered magnetic resonance image, which served as an anatomical guide. The total distribution volume (VT) of [ 11 C]CHIBA-1001 was calculated from the regional time-activity curve and the metabolite-corrected input function using Logan graphical analysis. 36,37) Blocking rates (%) by tropisetron or ondansetron were calculated for each ROI as 100×[(V T at baseline−V T at loading)/V T at baseline]%.
