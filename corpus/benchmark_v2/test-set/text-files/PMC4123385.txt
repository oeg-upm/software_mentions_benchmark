In total, 31,653 EST-SSR loci were identifi ed in the transcriptome sequence data from the related species P. tabuliformis (SRA accession: SRA056887, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). The sequences were analyzed for potential SSRs using Simple Sequence Repeat Identifi cation Tool (SSRIT) software ( Temnykh et al., 2001 ; http://www.gramene.org/db/markers/ssrtool/ ). A set of 702 SSRs was identifi ed that met a requirement for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide sequences with a minimum of 12, 6, 5, 5, 5, and 5 repeats, respectively. Among these, 175 SSRs were selected randomly for primer design, excluding the SSRs located at the loci termini. Primer pairs were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, California, USA) ( Wei et al., 2012 ) with the following criteria: primer lengths of 16-22 bp, GC content of 40-65%, annealing temperature ( T a ) ranging from 40 ° C to 60 ° C, and a predicted PCR product size ranging from 100 to 500 bp.
(CTAB) method ( Porebski et al., 1997 ). The samples were collected from a single seed orchard in Qigou, Hebei Province (41 ° 0 ′ 13 ″ N, 118 ° 27 ′ 38 ″ E) and deposited at the National Engineering Laboratory for Forest Tree Breeding, China (NELFTB). All trees in the seed orchard derived from Honghuaerji in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. PCR amplifi cations were performed in 20-μ L volumes that included 50-80 ng of genomic DNA, 5 μ M concentrations of each primer, and 10 μ L 2 × PCRMaster Mix consisting of 0.1 unit/ μ L Taq DNA polymerase, 4 mM MgCl 2 , and 0.4 mM dNTP (Aidlab Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). The PCR reactions were performed in a Veriti Dx 96-well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 ° C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 ° C for 30 s, annealing for 45 s at the optimal temperature for each primer pair , and 72 ° C for 30 s, with a fi nal extension of 10 min at 72 ° C ( Table 1 ). PCR products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels using an HT-CX01 gel sequencing cell (Hongtao Jiye Technology Development Co. Ltd., Beijing, China). SSR patterns were visualized by silver staining.To identify potential functions of the 25 SSR-associated unigenes, the sequences were aligned with the GenBank database using the BLASTX program (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) ( Yang et al., 2012 ). The E -value was limited to 0-1.0E -5 . Gene Ontology (GO) was also used to predict functions of the unigenes (http://geneontology.org/). Eighteen sequences were found to have potential functions by BLASTX or GO analysis . These sequences showed signifi cant homology to protein sequences from Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carrière, Picea glauca Voss, Selaginella moellendorffi i Hieron., Vitis vinifera L., Cucumis sativus L., and Zea mays L. The potential functions were mainly related to ionic bonding, oxidation-reduction processes, and feedback regulation ( Table 3 ).
