Bioinformatics and ChIP assays. The VISTA bioinformatics tool was used to determine conserved noncoding sequences. ChIP assays were per formed as described previously (Kang et al., 2011). CD4 + T cells (5 × 10 6 naive per sample), cultured in the presence of 100 U/ml IL2, 1.5 µg/ml concanavalin A, and 10 nM RA for 4-5 d, were used for ChIP assays. DNA protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using 4 µg antiBATF (rabbit polyclonal; Cell Signaling Technology), antiRAR (rabbit polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-acetylhistone H4 antibodies (EMD Millipore). Realtime PCR detection using the primers described in Table S3 was conducted with a 7500 Sequence Detection System using the SYBR green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
