The hippocampal neurons derived from E-18 pregnant SpragueDawley female rats were prepared as described. 42 Briefly, the embryonic hippocampi were dissected, dissociated with papain and triturated with a polished, half-bore Pasteur pipette. Dissociated neurons (2.5 Â 10 5 ) in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.6% glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics were plated on poly-D-lysine-coated glass coverslips in a 60 mm Petri dish. Four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with Neurobasal media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B-27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, to which 4 mM of 1-b-D-cytosine-arabinofuranoside (Ara-C, Sigma) was added as needed. Neurons were transfected using a modified calciumphosphate method. 18 Briefly, 6 mg of cDNA and 9.3 ml of 2 M CaCl 2 were mixed in distilled water to a total volume of 75 ml, and the same volume of 2X BBS was added. Neurobasal medium was completely replaced by transfection medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.6% glucose, 10 mM glutamine and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid, pH 7.65), and the cDNA mixture was added to the neurons, and incubated in a 5% CO 2 incubator for 90 min. Neurons were washed twice with washing medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.6% glucose, 10 mM glutamine and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid (N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid), pH 7.35) and then returned to the original culture medium. The vGlut-pHluorin (vGpH) and pU6mRFP constructs were cotransfected in a ratio of 5:1. The construct vGpH harbors vesicular glutamate transporter 1 fused with pHluorin, a modified GFP with high pH sensitivity. 43 When targeted to the synaptic vesicle lumen, vGpH is quenched and upon exocytosis, the relatively basic pH of the extracellular space allows it to fluoresce. Its fluorescence is again quenched after endocytosis and re-acidification of the synaptic vesicles. Thus, this process accurately reflects the kinetics of exoendocytic trafficking of synaptic vesicles. 43,44 Synaptic vesicle pool size measurement and image analysis Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion/stimulation chamber equipped with platinum-iridium field stimulus electrodes (EC-S-10, LCI, Seoul, Korea) on the stage of an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope with Â 40, 1.0 NA oil lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Neurons were continuously perfused at room temperature with Tyrode solution (136 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 1.3mM MgCl 2 , 10mM N-2-hydroxyl piperazine-N 0 -2-ethane sulfonic acid, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.3). To reduce spontaneous activity and prevent recurrent excitation during stimulation, 10 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione and 50 mM of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid were added to the Tyrode solution. Time-lapse images were acquired every 5 s for 4 min using a back-illuminated Andor iXon 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technologies, Belfast, Northern Ireland) driven by MetaMorph Imaging software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). From the fourth frame, neurons were stimulated (1 ms, 20-50 V, bipolar) using an A310 Accupulser current stimulator (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) to mimic action potential generation. Quantitative measurement of fluorescence intensity at individual boutons was obtained by averaging a selected area of pixel intensities using MetaMorph software. Individual regions were selected by hand. Then, rectangular regions of interest were drawn around the synaptic boutons, and average intensities were calculated. Large puncta, typically representative of smaller synapse clusters, were rejected during the selection procedure. The center of intensity of each synapse was calculated to correct for any image shift over the course of the experiment. Fluorescence was expressed in intensity units that correspond to fluorescence values averaged over all pixels within the region of interest. Changes in net fluorescence were obtained by subtracting the average intensity of the first four frames (F 0 ) from the intensity of each frame (F t ) for individual boutons. They were then normalized to the maximum fluorescence intensity (F max ÀF 0 ) and averaged. For the exocytosis assays, neurons were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for 60 s to block re-acidification and stimulated for 30 s at 20 Hz/600 action potentials (APs), a combination, which is known to totally deplete the recycling pool of vesicles. 44 Bafilomycin A1 was dissolved in Me 2 SO at 0.2 mM and diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mM prior to the experiments. Bafilomycin A1 was applied throughout the fluorescence measurements.
