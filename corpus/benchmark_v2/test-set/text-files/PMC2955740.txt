Prior to photoinhibition treatments, two leaf disks (2.8 cm 2 ) were always cut off from each leaf and analysed as control samples. In the middle and at the end of each continuous-light illumination treatment, two leaf disks were cut off from the illuminated area and used for measurements of fluorescence and oxygen evolution. One time point was used in the flash photoinhibition treatments. Pearson correlation coefficients and P-values reflecting their statistical significance were calculated with SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
