Images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ. For timelapse microscopy quantification of populations the background was subtracted for every image series using rolling ball background subtraction. Furthermore, the image series were manually screened and series with fluorescent aggregates were excluded from the analysis. Subsequently, integrated fluorescent intensities were calculated and values were normalized for each series on the time point before inhibitor addition. Mean values of at least 8 individual positions per condition were calculated.
