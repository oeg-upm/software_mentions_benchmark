Comparison of kidney/body weight (KBW) mutant male vs. female curves was performed using generalized linear model in R (Team, 2014) and the effect size was estimated calculating Cohen's d with the compute.es package in R. Analysis of KBW in mutants fed NIH31 or NIH37 was done using Student's t test. Real time PCR data was analyzed fitting an anova model including within subject error. Fatty acid oxidation assay results for five technical (well) replicates were averaged for each cell line and genotype. The corresponding five pairs of means were analyzed using paired t-test.
Raw Illumina gene expression data were processed using variance stabilization and quantile normalization with the lumi package (Du et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2008) in R (Team, 2014), filtered to include only probes with detection call p value b0.05 in at least seven of the arrays, followed by batch-removal using COMBAT (Johnson et al., 2007). Same-gene probes were consolidated to a single identifier keeping the probe with highest mean value. Detection of differentially expressed genes was performed using linear models and empirical Bayes methods implemented in the limma package (Smyth, 2004) in R. For time course analysis, splines and limma packages in R were used to fit separate curves in mutant males and females for each gene, and then the parameters corresponding to the interaction of time and sex were evaluated to identify genes with different temporal profile. Comparisons between mutant and control within sex were done in limma analyzing contrasts comparing samples collected at three different time intervals. Genes with fdr-p b 0.05 were considered differentially expressed.
Kidney samples were submitted to the West Coast Metabolomics Center, at University of California, Davis, and processed according to the facility's protocols. Briefly, lipidomics workflow involves sample extraction in MTBE with addition of internal standards, followed by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) on a Waters CSH column, interfaced to a QTOF mass spectrometer (performed using an Agilent 1290 Infinity LC system (G4220A binary pump, G4226A autosampler, and G1316C Column Thermostat) coupled to either an Agilent 6530 (positive ion mode) or an Agilent 6550 mass spectrometer equipped with an ion funnel (iFunnel) (negative ion mode)), with a 15 min total run time. Data were collected in both positive and negative ion mode, and analyzed using MassHunter (Agilent) to assign a unique ID to each lipid based on its retention time and exact mass (RT_mz). For GC-TOF, samples were prepared and analyzed using Gerstel CIS4 -with dual MPS Injector, Agilent 6890 GC and Pegasus III TOF MS, as described in (Fiehn et al., 2008).
