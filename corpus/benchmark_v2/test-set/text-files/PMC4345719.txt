Statistical analyses were performed with the software package SPSS 19.0 J for Windows (SPSS Inc., IL, USA). Categorical variables were assessed with the Pearson chi-square test, and quantitative variables were compared with unpaired 2-tailed t tests. A P value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
