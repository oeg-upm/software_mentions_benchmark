Five multivariate linear models were successively fitted to examine associations between HbA 1c and measures of OSA severity after controlling for multiple covariates. Model 1 included demographic variables traditionally associated with glycemic control, namely, age, sex, ethnicity-based diabetes risk, BMI, years of type 2 diabetes, and insulin use. Model 2 included all the covariates in model 1 plus total AHI. Model 3 included all the covariates in model 1 plus NREM AHI. Model 4 included all the covariates in model 1 plus REM AHI. Lastly, model 5 included all the covariates in model 1 plus NREM AHI and REM AHI. Since there are individuals who have a significant number of apneas and hypopneas during REM sleep while having an overall AHI below 5 (hence no OSA based on current definitions), we included all 115 subjects (with or without OSA) in the multivariate regression models in order to explore the entire spectrum of REM and NREM events (AHI, ODI, and MAI). We formally ruled out any evidence of collinearity among the variables entered in the models using standard statistics, including "tolerance" and "variance inflation factor" (SPSS Statistics v20,IBM, Armonk, NY). Values for HbA 1c , years of type 2 diabetes, and REM and NREM AHI were submitted to natural log (Ln) transformation. In order to deal with zero values, the total AHI, REM AHI, and NREM AHI were log transformed using the formula AHI = log(AHI + 0.01). A similar procedure was used for years of type 2 diabetes. We used casewise diagnostics to identify any outliers. Only one outlier was identified (low HbA 1c ), and sensitivity analysis excluding this subject was performed confirming the association between HbA 1c and measures of REM OSA severity. Goodness of fit of the models was assessed using diagnostic plots.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics v20 and verified using Stata (v10.1, College Station, TX).
