VC was performed using a CO 2 SMOS Plus 8100 Dixtal/ Novametrix ® (Respironics, Murrisville, PA, USA). The subjects remained breathing tidal volume for 4 minutes. During this time, the variables were measured and data was stored in a computer with the Analysis Plus ® software. At the end of data collection, an offline sequence of the respiratory cycles of the subjects was selected to accommodate a variation of ,15% for expiratory tidal volume and of ,5% for ETCO 2 tension. Respiratory cycles that had Slp2 and Slp3 equal to zero were excluded. The main variables analyzed were ETCO 2 , Slp2, Slp3, inspiratory time (T i ), expiratory time (T e ), and expiratory volume (V e ). Both slopes are given by the Analysis Plus ® software. An example of a capnogram, which represents the total amount of CO 2 eliminated by the lungs during each breath, can be seen in Figure 1.
