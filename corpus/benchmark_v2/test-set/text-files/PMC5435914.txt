Illumina pipeline analyzed short reads were uniquely aligned allowing at best two mismatches to the UCSC (The Genome Sequencing Consortium) human genome version hg18, using the program BOWTIE (19). Peak caller algorithm MACS (version 1.4) was used to determine enriched peak region with parameters: -nomodel, -tsize = 46, -bw = 300. Shift size were determined using Pyicos (20) strand correlation method. Enriched peaks were annotated to nearest EnsEMBL (21) gene (EnsEMBL Biomart version 54) using Bioconductor package ChIPpeakAnno (22). Distribution of enriched reads along the genomes and transcription start site (TSS) of RefSeq genes were determined using CEAS (23). Data from ChIP-seq experiments have been deposited in GEO (accession number GSE93975).
To determine the over-represented short sequence motifs in enriched peaks, we used total 100nt sequences (from peak summit, 50 bp down and 50 bp up). We used top 1000 peaks (based on fold change) for finding motifs using bothWEEDER (24) and MEME (25) programs.
Functional annotation of target genes is based on Gene Ontology (GO) (26) Consortium, 2000; (http://www. geneontology.org) as extracted from EnsEMBL (21) and KEGG pathway database (27). Accordingly, all genes are classified into the ontology categories biological process (GOBP) and pathways when possible. We have taken only the GO/pathway categories that have at least 10 genes annotated. We used Gitools for enrichment analysis and heat map generation (28) (http://www.gitools.org). Resulting Pvalues were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamin and Hochberg's method of False Discovery Rate (29). Enrichment analysis was also performed using the public DAVID tools (Database for Annotation, visualization and integrated discovery v 6.7) (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) (30).
Possible occurrence of TF motifs in peak regions (150 bp around peak summit) and overrepresentation of these TFs is based on the tool Pscan (32) with parameter: mixed background hg18, TRANSFAC matrix. Pscan evaluates local enrichment, comparing with a t-test mean and standard deviation of the score of the best matching oligonucleotides in the input regions to mean and standard deviation of the best match in the genomic regions flanking the input ones. Local enrichment can be used to identify motifs with significant preference for binding within the regions, that is, the motif corresponding to the ChIP'ed TF, as well as other TFs likely to interact with it and binding in its neighborhood. Local enrichment P-value (L.PV): describing whether the motif is over-or underrepresented in the 150 bp input regions with respect to the genomic regions flanking them, indicating whether the motif is overrepresented.
Overlap of genomic position range data was done usingBedTools (33) and significance of overlap was analyzed by Hypergeometric test. However, Venn-diagram generation and overlap of target genes analysis was performed using in-house R programming language script. Significance of overlap calculated based on Chi-square test. Unless stated, peak overlap is defined as overlap by at least 1 bp.
Asynchronously growing HCT116 cells were washed with PBS and RNA was isolated from 3 different sets of cells transfected with shRNA control or shRNAPCAF. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Iberia, Madrid, Spain). RNA quality control was done with Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Samples were then hybridized with Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Dataset obtained by Expression Console (Affymetrix) were analyzed by DNA-ChIP Analyzer (dChIP) software and tools. The normalization of the arrays was performed using the robust multi-array average (RMA) method as implemented in the Affymetrix package of R bioconductor. Quality control measurements were obtained with ArrayQualityMetrics, while the statistical analysis of significant hits with Limma (35). Data from expression microarray experiments have been deposited in GEO (accession number GSE93694).
