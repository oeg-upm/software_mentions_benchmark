As mentioned before, the KKT conditions of the period-3 problem of the PNP model constitute a LCP. We solve it, for each contingent state, by minimizing the complementarity conditions subject to the linear equality constraints and the non-negativity constraints. 17 The period-2 problem of the PNP model is an EPEC, in which each firm faces a Mathematical Program subject to Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC). 18 We attempt to solve for equilibrium, if at least one exists, by iterative deletion of dominated strategies. That is, we sequentially solve each firm's profit-maximization problem using as data the optimal values from previously solved problems. Thus, starting from a feasible solution, we solve for g 1 using g (−1) as data in the first firm's optimization problem (where g (−1) means all firms' generation capacities except for firm 1's), then solve for 17 Recall that any LCP can be written as the problem of finding a vector x ∈ n such that x = q + M · y, x T · y = 0, x ≥ 0, and y ≥ 0, where M ∈ n×n , q ∈ n , and y ∈ n . Thus, we can solve it by minimizing x T · y subject to x = q + M · y, x ≥ 0, and y ≥ 0. If the previous problem has an optimal solution where the objective function is zero, then that solution also solves the corresponding LCP. Greater details about the methodology used for solving LCPs are given in (Hobbs, 2001). 18 See (Yao et al., 2004) for definitions of both EPEC and MPEC.g 2 using g (−2) as data, and so on. We solve each firm's profit-maximization problem using a sequential quadratic programming algorithm implemented inMATLAB . We test our model from a set of different starting points and using different generation-firms' optimization order. All these trials gave us the same results. For the PNP model, the optimal levels of generation capacity under absence of transmission investments are (g * 1 , g * 2 , g * 3 , g * 4 , g * 5 ,g * 6 ) = (100 92, 103.72, 101.15, 95.94, 77.07, 87.69) in MW. Table 3 lists the corresponding generation quantities (q i ), adjustment quantities (r i ) and nodal prices (P i ) in the normal state. Figure 4 illustrates these results for the Cornell network. In Fig. 4, thick lines represent the transmission lines reaching their thermal capacities (in the indicated direction) and circles are located in the nodes with the highest prices (above $48/MWh).
