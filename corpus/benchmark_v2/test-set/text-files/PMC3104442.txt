Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software for Windows, version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data were expressed as mean±SD or median (interquartile range, IQR) unless otherwise specified. The cut-off value of cTnT for an AMI was evaluated using a ROC curve. To determine the prognostic value of the initial serum cTnT concentrations in ESRD patients, we calculated survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method. The potential outcome predictors were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard analysis to determine the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in ESRD patients. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
