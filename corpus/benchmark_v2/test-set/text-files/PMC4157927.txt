The numbers of BrdU-positive, caspase-3-positive, Bax-positive, and TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were counted hemi-laterally using Image-Pro ® Plus computer-assisted image analysis system (Media Cyberbetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA) attached to a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). These data are expressed as the number of cells per square millimeter (mm 2 ) of cross-sectional area in each of the selected hippocampal dentate gyri. All values are expressed as the mean±stan-dard error of the mean (SEM). For comparisons among the groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's post-hoc test were performed with a P<0.05 as an indication of statistical significance.
