Five articles that describe the clinical PK of citrate in healthy subjects were identified and used in this analysis. 11-15 The means of longitudinal plasma citrate measurements, corresponding study size (n), and standard deviations (SD) were read from tables or digitized from figures (with PlotDigitizer.exe) to use in this modeling.
Literature-based analysis of hepatic citrate flux in human Both fixed and random effect approaches were used to estimate the weighted mean of hepatic citrate flux in humans using R 3.0.2 with meta-analysis library (metafor). The data from the literature and R code are provided in Supporting Information III & IV. The fixed effect approach assumed that the true mean was the same in all studies; as such, the flux from each study was weighted by sampling errors within the study only. In contrast, the random effect approach assumed that heterogeneity existed among the studies, and sampling errors of both within and between studies were used for weighting. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the estimated values, combined with individual reported values, were included in one forest plot for visualization.
