Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope with LSM software. In some cases, images were transferred to ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD), where the "despeckle" feature was used to decrease nonspecific background fluorescence levels. Finally, images were exported into Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA) for cropping, resizing, and adjustment of brightness and contrast levels.
