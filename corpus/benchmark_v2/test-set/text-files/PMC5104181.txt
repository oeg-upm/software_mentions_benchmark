Western blotting. Protein was extracted using conventional protocols (9 M urea, 4% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 1% dithiothreitol, 0.5% carrier ampholytes and cocktail of protease inhibitors). Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) with bovine serum album as a standard. Subsequently, proteins were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gels using standard sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked by 5% milk (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 1 h and probed with specific antibodies for 4˚C overnight. Mouse anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibodies (dilution, 1 µg/ml; catalog no., 3362R-100; BioVision, Inc., Milpitas, CA, USA) were used, and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase monoclonal antibodies (dilution, 0.3 ng/µl; catalog no., 60004-1-Ig; ProteinTech Group, Rosemont, IL, USA) were used as an internal reference. After three washing steps of 15 min each with Tris-buffered saline and Tween (TBST), the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (dilution, 1:5,000; catalog no., sc-2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., USA) at 37˚C for 1 h. After three washing steps of 15 min each with TBST, the protein was tested by chemiluminescence detection (catalog no., 29100; Engreen Biosystem Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The protein expression was analyzed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).
Cell migration assay. Cell motility was evaluated by two experiments. In the wound healing experiment, channels were created by making a scratch in a 6-well plate. Subsequently, 8x10 5 cells per channel were seeded into the 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h. At 0, 12 and 24 h, the wounds were observed and pictures were taken using a phase-contrast microscope. The areas of the scratch were calculated using Alpha View Analysis Tools version 1.0 software (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA, USA), and this was used to calculate the percentage of wound closure.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Quantitative variables were compared using the one-way analysis of variance. The χ 2 test was used to assess qualitative variables. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
