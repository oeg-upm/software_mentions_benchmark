Tissue assessments. The primary end point of the study was to determine the effects of treatment on tumour stroma including assessment of collagen content and structure and CAFs. In addition to study samples obtained from patients and mouse models, we also analysed a set of six samples from patients with untreated PDA and six samples from patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Collagen analysis was assessed using collagen I primary rabbit antibody (1 : 100; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 1 h at 37 1C and as secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Activated fibroblasts were determined with double staining using vimentin, as total fibroblasts marker (1 : 50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) as an activated fibroblast marker (1 : 100; DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for vimentin and Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1 : 200; Invitrogen) for SMA. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were acquired using a laser scanning confocal microscope TCS-SP5 (AOBS) Leica (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with two magnifications Â 20 HCX PL APO CS (0.7 NA) and Â 40 HCX PL APO CS (1.25 NA) oil immersion objectives. Acquisition Software was LAS AF v.2.4.1 (Leica Microsystems). Fibroblast quantification was performed with Definiens Developer XD Software (Munich, Germany). Detected cells were classified depending on the ratio between mean layer intensities of both, vimentin and SMA. Activated fibroblasts were considered when they co-expressed SMA and vimentin. We determined the fibroblast density index by adjusting the number of cells counted to the proportion of tumour fibrosis observed in the specimen (adapted from Erkan et al, 2008). The quantification was done in two different and representative fields (20 steps) for each sample. In the preclinical study, immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against mouse SPARC (R&D Systems, MAB942, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9661).
Statistical analysis. The analysis was made by 'intention to treat' with all patients included using the IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20.0 (IBM, Madrid, Spain). Quantitative variables pre-and posttreatment were compared using ANOVA test, Student's t-test, and non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test for two related samples. The correlation between the outcome variables was tested with the Spearman correlation coefficient. In the preclinical study, all values are represented as mean ± s.e.m. Immunohistochemistry quantifications were evaluated for significance using the unpaired t-test with a P-value below 0.05 considered significant for all analyses. Significant differences between experimental groups were: *Po0.05 or **Po0.01.
