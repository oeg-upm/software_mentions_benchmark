Oxidative stress. Tissue ROS levels were measured by the conversion of nonfluorescent 2Ј, 7Ј-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFDA) to the highly fluorescent 2Ј, 7Ј-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) in the presence of esterases and ROS (26) (for details, see the supplementary methods available in an online appendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0079). Activity of mitochondrial aconitase was measured in isolated mitochondria as described previously (27). RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from hearts with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), purified with the RNEasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and reverse transcribed (6). Data were normalized by expressing them relative to the levels of the invariant transcript 16S RNA. Primer sequences and accession numbers are presented in supplementary Table 1. Western blot analysis. Isolated mitochondria or whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously and resolved by SDS-PAGE (5,6). For antibody conditions see supplementary methods in the online appendix. Protein concentrations were determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and equal protein loading was verified by Coomassie staining. Statistical analysis. Data are presented as means Ϯ SE. When comparing two groups, significance was determined using a Student's t test. Effects of calcium-induced increase in contractility were analyzed using a paired t test. Analysis of working heart perfusions Ϯ insulin was performed using one-way ANOVA. Significance was assessed by Fisher's protected least significant difference test. For all analyses, the Statview 5.0.1 software package was used (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and significant difference was accepted when P Ͻ 0.05.
