Univariate analyses were primarily used for the selection of variables, based on P value less than 0.1. Selected variables, including APACHE II score, SOFA score, Ang-1 levels, Ang-2 levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate were entered into a Cox proportional hazards model to identify the net effects of each individual factor. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess independent contributions of significant factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for day 1 APACHE II scores, plasma levels of Ang-1, Ang-2, CRP, and lactate for predicting the development of MODS and mortality during ICU stay were plotted, and the respective areas under the curves were calculated. A P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analysis was done using the SPSS software version 10.0 (Chicago, IL).
