The synovium-infiltrating cells (SIC) from arthritic Lewis rats treated with the vehicle (control) or Celastrol (test) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Quality Biologics) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For cytokine measurements, cells were stimulated for 5 h with 50 ng/mL PMA and 2 µM ionomycin in the presence of Brefeldin A (BD GolgiPlug). Cells were then treated with 10% normal rat serum to block non-specific binding sites. Thereafter, the T cells were surface-stained with anti-CD3 APC, anti-CD4 PerCP eFlour 710, anti-CD8β FITC, and/or anti-CD25 PE (all from eBioscience). Antigenpresenting cells (APCs) and neutrophils were surface-stained with anti-CD45 APC, anti-CD11b/c PerCP eFlour 710, anti-rat granulocyte marker FITC, anti-MHCII FITC, anti-CD80 PE (all from eBioscience), and/or anti-CD86 PE (BD). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the BD Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Bioscience) and stained using anti-rat/mouse IL-17A eFlour 450 (eBioscience) and anti-IFN-γ PE (Biolegend). Foxp3 was stained using anti-mouse/rat Foxp3 eFlour 450 (eBioscience) in Foxp3 buffer (eBioscience). Flow cytometric data was acquired on LSRII (BD Bioscience) with gating set on isotype controls, and analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). Cell numbers were calculated from frequencies using live cell counts by Trypan blue dye and a hemocytometer.
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM as calculated by GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). Differences in the mean values were analyzed using a Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons. Significance was set as P<0.05.
