Data were entered, cleaned, and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize and present the data. To determine the relationship between self-reported academic performance and the different independent variables, bivariate Pearson's correlation analysis was done three times (for total participants, and for preclinical, and clinical student subcategories). Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the cumulative and individual effects of each independent variable as well as to control confounding effects.
