Data collection and coding. Two reviewers (I.H.K.L. and C.C.W.) coded each outcome measure into one cognitive or behavioral domain based on the categorization provided in Strauss et al., 13 A Compendium of Neuropsychological Tests, whenever possible. Other outcomes were coded by consensus and approved by A.L. (see table e-1 for categorization of outcomes by domains). Outcomes were recorded as mean and SD for each group at baseline and follow-up or as means and SDs of pre-post change. All data were entered into Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) version 2 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ), and utilized an a priori pre-post correlation of 0.6.
