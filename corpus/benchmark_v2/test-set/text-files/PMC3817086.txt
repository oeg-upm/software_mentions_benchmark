Paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with anti-MLKL antibody (1:60 dilution, ab118348; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4°C overnight. Rabbit immunoglobulin G was used as a negative control. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the slides were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA, USA) at room temperature for 30 minutes. After washing three times with PBS, the slides were stained with the ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories Inc). Finally, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and then mounted with Permount mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Histological images were captured from the microscope (Carl Zeiss AX10; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) with an objective magnification of X40, and high-resolution digital images were acquired and processed with Axionvision software (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG). MLKL staining was scored independently by two pathologists and was calculated using a previously defined scoring system. 15,16 Briefly, the proportion of positive tumor cells was scored as: 0= less than 5%; 1+=5%-20%; 2+=21%-50%; and 3+.50%. The intensity was arbitrarily scored as 0= weak (no color or light blue), 1= moderate (light yellow), 2= strong (yellow brown), and 3= very strong (brown). The
The relationship between the expression of MLKL and patient's age, histological type, pathologic grade, and FIGO stage were analyzed using the χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. OS curves and DFS curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox regression models. P-values less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Data were analyzed using the SPSS (version 20.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) software program.
