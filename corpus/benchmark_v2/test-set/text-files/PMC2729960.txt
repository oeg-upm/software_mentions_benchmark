Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 11.0 for WINDOWS. The Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman correlation were used to test for significant differences in the total SIB, K-MMSE and S-ADL scores according to sex, age and education. The validity of the SIB was determined by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients between the SIB and the K-MMSE, CDR, and S-ADL. Cronbach's coefficient alpha and item-total correlation coefficients were generated to examine the internal consistency of the SIB. Also, Spearman correlation coefficients were generated to evaluate the 3 months test-retest reliability. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the differences in the mean SIB total score for the various CDR stages. Finally, a ROC curve was used to compare the sensitivity, specificity and probability of correctly discriminating dementia severity in the case of the SIB, K-MMSE and S-ADL.
