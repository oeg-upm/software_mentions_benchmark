Cells were lysed for 20 min on ice in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5 M sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, complete protease inhibitor cocktail, PhosSTOP [Roche]). Protein concentration was quantitated using the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma-Aldrich). Antibodies used in overnight incubations were anti-AIM-1 1:400 (611082; BD Bioscience), anti-LEM4 (1:2000), and anti-GFP (Yavuz et al., 2010). Bands were quantified in Fiji using the Gel Analyzer tool and normalized relative to a standard on each gel consisting of either wild-type HeLa cells or ZFN clone HZ2.
where N = cV eff is the number of fluorescent molecules in the focal volume V eff and c their concentration, ρ is the fraction of molecules in a nonfluorescent state with a lifetime τ blink , and α is the anomaly parameter of diffusion resulting in a mean dwell time τ diff of the molecules in the focus. The diffusion coefficient D = w 0 2 /4τ diff and the concentration c were extracted after calibrating the focal volume V eff = π 3/2 w 0 3 s and the lateral and axial focal radii w 0 and sw 0 using FCS measurements of Alexa 488 with a known diffusion coefficient. For FCS data processing we used the Fluctuation Analyzer software (written by Malte Wachsmuth, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany; available upon request).
Automated FCS with single-cell tracking was performed using an in-house-adapted Zeiss 780 ConfoCor3 system. Image and FCS acquisition were coordinated using a custom-written VBA macro (AutofocusScreen, available on request), which coordinated then stained with 40 μg/ml propidium iodide containing 0.1% Triton-100 and RNase A overnight at room temperature to ensure saturation of DNA staining. Cell cycle-stage analysis was performed by fitting with the cell cycle Watson (pragmatic) algorithm in FlowJo v7.6.4 software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Live-cell microscopy was at 37°C in CO 2 -independent medium without phenol red (Invitrogen). A Zeiss 780 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63× PlanApochromat, numerical aperture (NA) 1.4 oil objective was used to acquire 512 × 512 pixel images with a pixel size of 0.439 μm at 5-min intervals. The z-stacks of eight slices spaced equally through 22.4 μm were acquired and formed into maximum-intensity z-projections. Automatic detection of nuclei in the H2B-mCherry channel and subsequent analysis of movies for mitotic timing were with CellCognition software as described previously (Held et al., 2010). Briefly, six morphological classes were defined: interphase, prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The training set contained >1000 manually labeled nuclei, which were annotated with an overall accuracy of >95% in the cross-validation. To reduce the effect of classification errors on autofocusing, image acquisition, image analysis, and FCS. mCherry-H2B images of nuclei were thresholded on the fly in Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012) such that two FCS measurement positions per cell in the cytoplasm could be specified. FCS measurements were acquired for 10 s per position, with imaging and FCS repeated at 15 min intervals. Cells were aligned to metaphase after data acquisition.
