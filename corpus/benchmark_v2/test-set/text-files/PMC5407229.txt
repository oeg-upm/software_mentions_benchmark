Data was analyzed using IBM© SPSS© Statistics version 21 (IBM© Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe the normally distributed variables while median and interquartile range (IQR) were used to describe nonnormally distributed variables. Categorical variables were described using frequency and percentage. Comparison of the P-EHEALS scores between genders and departments was performed using independent-samples t-test, while the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare p-EHALS scores between monthly income categories. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of minutes of Internet use between groups. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation of age with P-EHEALS score, while the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between minutes of Internet use and P-EHEAS score.
