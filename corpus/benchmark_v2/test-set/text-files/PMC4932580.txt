Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, 2013). Descriptive statistics for the sensory evaluation, WBS, and TPA parameters were calculated using the MEAN procedure. The Pearson correlation coefficients between sensory evaluation and the instrumental measurements were determined using the CORR procedure. To establish regression models for sensory evaluation variables, the WBS and TPA parameters were used as independent variables in the REG procedure. A stepwise procedure was used to estimate the percentage of variation in sensory evaluation that was explained by the instrumental measurements.
