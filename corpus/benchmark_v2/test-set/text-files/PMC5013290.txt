All results were presented as mean Â± standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with a two-tailed Student's t test. Significant differences were assigned P values of < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001, which were denoted by *, **, and ***, respectively. All statistical values were calculated with SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, USA).
