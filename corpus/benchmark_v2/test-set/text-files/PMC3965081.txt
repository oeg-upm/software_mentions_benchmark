As sample data can be identified by multiple accessions assigned by EBI and external databases an identifier and URL resolution service 'MyEquivalents' has been deployed. It provides mapping between different, but equivalent, sample identifiers. For example, human RNA-Seq data deposited at EBI may have identifiers for ArrayExpress, ENA and BioSamples database as these resources share records. In time the BioSamples database identifier will be the only sample identifier for new submissions, but until then, and to preserve backwards compatibility for legacy data, the MyEquivalents service provides redirection URLs and web services describingAuto-complete on the search box suggests appropriate ontology and keyword terms as the query is entered by the user, including more specific terms from EFO such as subtypes of the disease. Highlighted results are colour coded for clarity; exact matches (yellow), synonyms (green) and more specific terms (red). mappings. More information and the source code for theMyEquivalents software is available (https://github.com/ EBIBioSamples/myequivalents).
