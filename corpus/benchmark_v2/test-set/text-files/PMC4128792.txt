To investigate global protein expression in A549 cells after exposure to 20 μg/mL ZnONPs or Al-ZnONPs, supernatant fractions were collected after 2 and 4 hours of exposure. The preparation of samples for proteomic analyses has been reported previously. 19 Briefly, the supernatants were diluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The samples were denatured and reduced with 8 M urea/10 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The samples were then digested with trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and desalted by C18 columns. The tryptic peptides were then analyzed using a Q Exactive™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with an Dionex UltiMate ® 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were separated by liquid chromatography using C18 columns (75×150 mm, 2 μm, Dionex Acclaim ® PepMap™ RSLC; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The separation conditions have been described previously. 19 Full mass spectrometry (MS) scans were performed using ranges of m/z 380-2,000, m/z 380-600, m/z 600-800, m/z 800-1,200, and m/z 1,200-2,000, and the ten most intense ions from the MS scans were selected for MS/MS scans. The raw data were processed into peak lists using Proteome Discoverer 1.3 for Mascot database searching (Matrix Science, London, UK) and National Center for Biotechnology Information UniProt database prediction and literature searching. The search parameters included variable modifications for deamidation (NQ), oxidation (M), and a fixed modification for carbamidomethyl (C). The maximum mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm for precursor ions and to 0.05 Da for fragment ions.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
