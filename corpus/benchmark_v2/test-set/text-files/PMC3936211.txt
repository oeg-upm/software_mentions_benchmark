Texture analysis. Textures of the samples were measured via neutron diffraction on the High Pressure Preferred Orientation (HIPPO) 27 time-of-flight diffractometer at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Samples with a surface size of 1.5 cm 2 were mounted in a way that the Cu-Nb interfaces were perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam and the rolling direction of the sample was parallel with the notch. Five banks of detector panels set at 2h 5 150u, 120u, 90u, 60u, and 40u, respectively, were used to collect diffraction data, while each bank created a full rotation (with regards to the neutron beam direction) of detection coverage. Each sample was rotated to specific angles of v 5 0u, 67.5u, and 90u to increase the coverage of the pole 27. A 10u resolution of the Rietveld refinement was chosen in order to simultaneously fit all the diffraction patterns to an orientation distribution function (ODF). Then, the rolling, normal, and transverse directions were properly aligned via the Matlab-based mtex program 35. Additionally, mtex was used for analysis of the ODFs and plotting the inverse pole figures (IPFs).
