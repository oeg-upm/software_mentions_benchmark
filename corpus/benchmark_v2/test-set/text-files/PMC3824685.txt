Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed for statistical significance usingSPSS 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test was applied to the examination of relationship between PDCD4 expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analysis was performed using KaplanMeier method. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards method was used for analyzing the relationship between the variables and patient's survival time. The relationship between PDCD4 and miR-184 expression was explored by Pearson test. Two-tailed Student's t test was used for comparisons of two independent groups. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for all in vitro analyses. A P-value of o0.05 was considered statistically significant.
