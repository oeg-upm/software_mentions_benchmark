The data were presented as means and standard deviation. Linear mixed models were used to compare the lipid profile in different exercises across time (condition√ótime). The Tukey post hoc was conducted if a significant difference was found. A paired t-test was conducted to compare area under curve (calculate by a trapezoidal method) between exercises. Statistical significance was set at P< 0.05. The data was analyzed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Standardized effect sizes were also calculated by the Cohen equations (Cohen, 1988) with the following threshold values: <0.2, trivial; >0.2 and <0.6, small; >0.6 and <1.2, moderate; >1.2 and <2.0, large; >2.0 and <4.0, very large; <4.0, nearly perfect (Hopkins, 2002). [trivial]) and tendency to difference from pre exercise (P=0.063, d=0.066 [trivial]). There was no effect for HDL-c, LDL-c, and cholesterol. For area under the curve there was no difference for any variable.
