Experion automated electrophoresis analysis. Samples for Experion Pro260 (BioRad) analysis were prepared by mixing 2 ml of sample buffer with 4 ml samples of protein extracts then loaded onto chips as recommended by the manufacturer. Electrophoresis runs were analyzed using the Experion software (BioRad) as summarised in Supporting Information (Supplementary Methods).
