Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 21.0. Chi-squared tests were used to compare the sociodemographic profile of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal participants. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for Aboriginal versus non-Aboriginal participants for physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep, neighborhood built environment and social support variables were estimated using forced entry binary logistic regression models, adjusting (where appropriate) for age and sex (Model 1). Models were further adjusted for remoteness of residence (Model 2) and education level (Model 3).
