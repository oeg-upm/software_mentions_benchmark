Reverse transcription (RT) -PCR: Total RNA was from PBMOs (1 × 10 6 ), immature DCs (1 × 10 6 ) or ovarian cells as a positive control. The RT reaction and the PCR for estrogen receptor (ER) α, ERβ and a housekeeping gene 18s rRNA was performed as previously described [6]. To perform the PCR for progesterone receptor (PR), usingPrimer 3 software [13], we designed primers as follows: sense, 5′-CAGGTGTACCAGCCGTACCT-3′; antisense, 5′-ACAGGTTGTGGGAGAGCAAC-3′.
Mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR): MLR was carried out as described previously [19]. In outline, PBMOs were incubated in the cultures for DC-induction with progesterone, 17-OHP or estrogen for 12 days. After the incubation, cells in graded doses were cultured with allogeneic PB mononuclear cells (10 5 ) Statistical analysis: Experimental groups were compared using analysis of variance followed by Fisher's protected least significant difference (PLSD), implemented using Stat- View ® software (Hulinks Inc., Tokyo, Japan). To compare two parameters against each other, Student's t test was used. The significance level was set at P<0.05.
