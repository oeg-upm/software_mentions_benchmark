The Kaplan -Meier method was pre-specified as the method for evaluating the safety objective so all patients with an implant attempt could be included in the analysis. However, since no USADEs were observed, the exact binomial test comparing the observed 3-month USADE free rate to the null value of 85% was used to evaluate the safety objective and derive the lower 97.5% confidence interval (CI). A onesample t-test comparing the observed mean 3-month pacing capture threshold to the null value of 2.0 V was used to test the efficacy objective. In addition, paired t-tests were used to compare electrical variables measured at implant and the 3-month visit. Statistical calculations were performed using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or R (www. r-project.org) and validated per the sponsor's operating procedures. The procedure duration was defined as the time from the insertion of the TPS introducer to removal. Time to hospital discharge was defined as the number of days from implant to hospital discharge.
