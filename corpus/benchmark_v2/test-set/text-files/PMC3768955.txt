Readings were compared with a standard curve prepared with a series of dilutions of NAG (0-5.0 mmol/mL) and 3, 5-dinitrosalicylic acids. The chitinase activity was assayed in triplicate and the average enzyme activity with standard deviations was measured using software of SPSS 11.5. One unit chitinase activity (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required for producing 1 mmol of NAG at 37 o C in 1 minute.
Where Y is the predicted response, x i and x j are the coded independent factors that influence the response variable Y, o is the intercept, i represents the linear effect of x i , ij represents the interaction between x i and x j , and ij represents the quadratic effect of x i .
