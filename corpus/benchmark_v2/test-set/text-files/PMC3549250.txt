The sample size was calculated using equivalence margins rather than probability levels: further details are presented in the companion paper. 8 The trial was powered to 90% and the minimum importance difference was 10% of cost. The results were analysed using an intention to treat and per protocol analysis. Economic evaluation data are invariably positively skewed, and it requires an alternative analysis. 13 14 The study data were analysed using a non-parametric bootstrapping technique. Bootstrapping makes no assumptions regarding the equality, variance or shape of the distribution, and takes into account skewness. 15 It derives arithmetic means recommended by some authors 10 that can be used to compare the groups and generates CIs using a computer-generated programme to repeatedly sample from the observed data which is then analysed. 10 13 15 The bootstrapping was undertaken using STATA V.9 software.
