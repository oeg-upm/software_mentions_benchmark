PASW ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the baseline scores with posttreatment scores. Paired t-test and chi-square test were used to analyze the efficacy of treatment between groups. Treatment outcome was analyzed by logistic regression, adjusted for age, prostate volume, IPSS, and category of CP/CPPS. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
