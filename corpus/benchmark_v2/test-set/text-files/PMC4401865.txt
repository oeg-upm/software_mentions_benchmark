SVM is a more sophisticated method; it is a very efficient learning algorithm for high-dimensional data in classification, regression and pattern recognition. The basis of SVM is to implicitly map data to a higher dimensional space via a kernel function in order to identify an optimal hyperplane that maximises the margin between the two groups. 27 There are many software packages available to implement SVM. In this study, we use thee1071-package of R with a default radial basis function kernel to obtain the prediction scores. 28 CVs of the prediction models In our simulation study, we perform a total of 5000 simulations. In each simulation, a total of 100 random partitions are performed for each fold CV (LOOCV, 10-fold, 5-fold, 3-fold and 2-fold CVs, respectively). From these, we use the previously described learning curve to make a one-step extrapolation to the cross-validated AUC when all the samples are utilised to train the model. For a comparison, we also calculate the internally validated AUCs of the LOO bootstrap in each simulation. This is a modified bootstrap procedure of the ordinary bootstrap. We draw a total of 100 resamplings. At each draw, the observations left out serve as the testing set. The effective (non-overlapping) training sample size of the LOO bootstrap is around 63.2% of the total sample size. 17 18 (Out-of-bag (OOB) 29 estimation employs a majority vote on the multiple prediction made for observation i based on the bootstrap samples at each draw, while the LOO bootstrap takes an average on error of these predictions. Therefore, OOB estimation may have larger variability than the LOO bootstrap when the sample size is small. 30) In the simulation, we additionally create a large data set of 1000 cases and 1000 controls for external validation. For a prediction model, an externally validated AUC against this data set is considered as its true AUC value (one true AUC for each round of simulation). It should be pointed out that in real practice, one rarely has the luxury to conduct such a large-scale external validation, but will often have to settle for a satisfactory internal validation method which is precisely the focal point of this paper.
