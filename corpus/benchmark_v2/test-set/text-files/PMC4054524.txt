Data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0 statistic software. The results for several of the hormone measurements were not normally distributed, so both paired t-tests and Wilcoxon's signed ranked test (for matched data) were used in the univariate analyses. Univariate analyses included: a) assessment of the before versus after changes in the measures of reproductive hormones in the amenorrhea group and, separately, in the control group; b) comparison of baseline values between cases and controls; c) comparison of post-treatment values for cases and controls; and d) comparison of the magnitude of the before versus after change in values in cases versus controls. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to determine whether or not any of the pre-treatment measures of reproductive hormones was associated with the occurrence of amenorrhea during treatment. The two-tailed level of significance was set at 0.05.
