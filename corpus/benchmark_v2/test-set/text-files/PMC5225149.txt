Total RNA extracted from Huh-7 cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the RT2 First-Strand Kit (SA Biosciences, Germany). The cDNA was then combined with RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SA Biosciences) and equal aliquots of this mixture were added to 96-well plates of the Human Apoptosis RT2 Profiler PCR Array (SA Biosciences) that contained the gene-specific primers, human ATGs PAHS012z (SA Biosciences). PCR was performed using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (ABI) with the following thermal cycling conditions: 15 min at 95 8 C for 1 cycle, 10s at 95 8 C, and 1 min at 60 8 C for 40 cycles. Expression of 84 key genes involved in apoptosis and 5 housekeeping genes (B2M, ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPLPO) was profiled. Threshold cycle data obtained was analyzed using the RT2 Profiler Software (version 3.5; SA Biosciences). Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2 âˆ’DDCT method.
All data are presented as mean with standard error of the mean (SEM). GraphPad Prism 5.0 was used to prepare all figures. Statistical significance of the data was analyzed using unpaired Student's t-test, and determined at a p value of <0.05 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
