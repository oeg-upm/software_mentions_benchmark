The main analyses included all participants with valid data. Sensitivity analyses also were conducted to account for the possible effects of infections and other factors on baseline levels of CRP, because these could distort the association of CRP with outcomes. This was performed by restricting the analyses to those participants with baseline levels of CRP #10 mg/L. All data analysis used SAS/STAT version 9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).). The median CRP was 1.8 mg/L (interquartile range 0.8-4.1) overall; 1.7 mg/L (0.8-3.6) in men and 2 mg/L (0 8- 4.5) in women (Wilcoxon test, P , 0.0001); and 3.2 mg/L (1.5-6.2) and 1.8 mg/L (0.8-4.0), respectively, in participants with and without diabetes (P , 0.0001). The relationships between quintiles of CRP and study covariates are depicted in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1 based on three subgroups of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/L). The least favorable levels of conventional risk factors were apparent in the higher CRP groups. Most of these relationships were stepwise across the CRP quintiles.CRP and outcomes overall and by diabetes status CRP was positively and continuously associated with CVD and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with an SD higher log e CRP conferring a 53% (95% CI 43-64) higher risk of cardiovascular death and a 43% (38-49) higher risk of death from any cause. In people with and without diabetes, an SD higher log e CRP was associated with 54% (28-85) and 52% (41-63), respectively, greater risk of cardiovascular death and 53% (35-72) and 41% (35-47), respectively, greater risk of all-cause mortality. There was little evidence of heterogeneity by diabetes status for those associations (both P $ 0.08 for interaction). Across quintiles of CRP distribution, there also was a graded association between CRP and mortality overall and in participants with and without diabetes. These associations were log linear for both allcause and cardiovascular mortality (all P , 0.0001 for log linearity) (Fig. 1). Across subgroups of participants based on three categories of CRP (i.e., ,1, 1-3, and .3 mg/L), there also was a graded association between CRP and outcomes, except in people with diabetes, for whom a higher risk of all-cause mortality was observed only in those within the upper stratum (Supplementary Table 2).
