Sample size calculation. Sample size was determined on the basis of the data from Kennedy and Scholey (2004). Mean change-from-baseline rapid visual information processing accuracy scores were averaged across the 30-, 40-and 50-min post-treatment measures for the 40 g caffeine plus 68 g glucose and the placebo conditions, respectively. The resulting effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.372 was used to calculate the sample size for a four-condition analysis of variance (ANOVA) using G*POWER v3.12 (Faul et al., 2007). This generated an N of 132 to detect a significant difference at an Î± level of 0.05 with 95% power. Given the exploratory nature of this study, and the possibility of attrition, the N was increased to 40/cell in order to optimise the chances of capturing treatment-related effects.
Data treatment and analysis. Data were analysed using the statistical software SPSS v20 for Windows unless otherwise stated.
Treatment guessing data were analysed by chi-square comparing the distribution of treatment guesses to chance within each condition using GRAPHPAD software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
