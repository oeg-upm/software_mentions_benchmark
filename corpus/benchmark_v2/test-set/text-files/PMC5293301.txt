The measurements quantify differences in flow within a single image in perfusion units. Perfusion and the area of each perfusion zone were calculated using the software LDPI win 3.1 (Perimed). 2. the picture shows an lDpi scan before the flap is raised. moving blood in the microvasculature causes a Doppler shift of scattered laser light, which is photodetected and then processed to build a color map of the blood flow. a digital camera records a colored clinical photograph at the same time, which corresponds closely with the blood flow image both in size and aspect. note that the color code shift toward red indicates higher perfusion.
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 21; Armonk, N.Y.) was used for data analysis. Nonparametric tests were used because of relatively few samples. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the intervention and control groups with respect to microcirculation for the different zones measured in perfusion units. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare microcirculation at 60 and 360 minutes for the different zones for each group. In addition, we have performed a Freidman test for intragroup comparison for the different time intervals for each zone; P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
