Resveratrol-loaded silk fibroin nanoparticles in TNBS rat colitis isolation. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured according to the technique described by Krawisz et al and the results were expressed as MPO units per gram of wet tissue; one unit of MPO activity was defined as that degrading 1 μmol hydrogen peroxide/min at 25°C. 26 The total glutathione content was quantified with the recycling assay described by Anderson, and the results were expressed as nmol/g wet tissue. 27 For the analysis of gene expression in colonic samples by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the total RNA from colonic samples was isolated using Trizol ® , following the manufacturer's protocol. All RNA samples were quantified with a Thermo Scientific Nano- (Table 1). To normalize messenger (m) RNA expression, the expression of the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was measured. The mRNA relative quantitation was calculated using the comparative CT (∆∆Ct) method. 28 statistics All results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between means were tested for statistical significance using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc least significance tests. Differences between proportions were analyzed with the chi-squared test. All statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA), with statistical significance set at P0.05.
