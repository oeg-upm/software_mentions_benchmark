Calculate Î© of the target protein/protein complex using the fit-determined constant, A, defined in Step 7: . 14. For each experimental condition, Steps 2 to 13 should be repeated. When defining the cross sectional area of the unknown protein or protein complex, we recommend that each experiment be repeated at least three times, and the standard deviation of these triplicate measurements determined.Scale (logarithmic data transform) will compress the intensity color code, and enable the simultaneous appearance of a broad range of intensities (as opposed to the linear and square root options, with which only the most intense peaks will become visible). 5. From the toolbar panel, Use Selection Tool button. This option will activate the different selection options, and enable selection of the relevant region within the spectrum. The most precise tool is Enable Region of Interest Selections, by means of which a border may be drawn around the region of interest, thereby excluding all unnecessary data and noise peaks. Likewise, the Orthogonal and Band Selection options are useful, when the region of interest is not surrounded by redundant peaks. 6. Once the region of interest is selected, use the Accept Current Selection command to remove unnecessary information. 7. Export the data to MassLynx, while retaining the drift time information.
