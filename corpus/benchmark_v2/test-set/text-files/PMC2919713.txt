Steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis were measured using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) assays. Reactions at 37 C contained 30 mM MES (pH 6.2), 6 mM MgCl 2 , 30 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT and 0.1 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 50 ml. The monovalent salt concentration was increased to 80 mM in certain reactions by the addition of 50 mM NaCl. In addition the reaction mixtures contained 2.0 mM wild-type or mutant Rad51 protein and 12 mM uX174 ssDNA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of a-[ 32 P]-ATP to a final concentration of 3 mM (10 mCi/ml final specific activity). Aliquots (8 ml) were removed at various time points and quenched with 8 mM EDTA and 1% SDS (final concentrations). Quenched samples were spotted out at 1 ml volume onto PEI-cellulose TLC plates (20 Ã‚ 20 cm) at 1-cm intervals. After all the samples were spotted and dried the TLC plates were developed with 0.75 M KH 2 PO 4 and allowed to air dry. The TLC plates were exposed for 1.5 h to a K-screen (Kodak) and scanned by a Bio-Rad Personal Molecular Imager-FX. Quantification of the phosphorimage was performed by Quantity One v4.5.1 (Bio-Rad) software and subsequently fit using KaleidaGraph v 3.6.2 (Synergy Software). The TLC assay was also used to measure the hydrolysis of ATP in samples identical to those used in nucleotidebinding EMSA experiments. Following incubation at 37 C for 2 h, 8 ml aliquots were removed and quenched with 8 mM EDTA and 1% SDS, spotted onto TLC plates and developed as described above.
