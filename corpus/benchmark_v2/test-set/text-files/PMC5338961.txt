Finger blood flows were compared between the supine and long sitting positions before SGB and 20 min after SGB. Next, we calculated the finger blood flow ratio as (the lowest finger blood flow in the long sitting position)/(finger blood flow in the supine position) both before and after SGB. We evaluated the difference in finger blood flow ratios before and after SGB. Statistical analysis of the data before and after SGB was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Stat view for Macintosh (version 5.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. p-Values <0.01 were considered to be significant.
