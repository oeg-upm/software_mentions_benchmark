The original eye-blink video was recorded with a high-speed camera (Fastec InLine 1000, Fastec Imaging, San Diego, CA, USA) at 500 frames/s in front of a white background. The videos were presented to the subject with Experiment Builder TM software v. 1.10.1 (SR Research, Ottawa, ON, Canada). Due to video-projector restrictions, the presentation frame rate was 60 frames/s, so that only every seventh frame of the normal-speed stimulus and every third frame of the slow-motion stimulus was shown. Both videos appeared smooth and natural. The background color and the luminance of the screen were matched to the background of the video.
To define the response onset, we searched for the best-fitting slope of the increasing areal mean response before the first prominent peak (polyfit function in Matlab Ã¢ version 8.0.0.783; MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA); before slope fitting, the peak amplitudes were normalized to 1. Response onset was defined as the crossing point of the slope and the mean + 2 standard deviations of the baseline amplitude.
