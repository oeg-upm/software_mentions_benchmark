The slopes of the error curves correspond to the error exponents. The improvements to the slopes of the Active-LATHE algorithm (the slopes are more negative for Active-LATHE compared to the passive algorithm) are especially pronounced when ρ is large. The large reductions of the error probability (the error exponent increases by at least 40%) shown in Figs. 3(a) to 5(a) greatly mitigate the inherent deficiencies of the passive learning for large ρ as discussed in Section 3.1. The code to reproduce the figures is available at this GitHub link.
