The participants were divided in to two groups of "stayer" (n=12) and "quitter" (n=6). "Stayers" were athletes who have practiced karate throughout the previous 18 months for three or more days a week. "Quitters" were adolescents who stopped exercising karate for at least 6 months and were not willing to start again. The "quitter" group was questioned about the reason of quitting karate. There were four choices: parental prohibition i.e., "My parents don't allow me to take karate classes anymore." personal motivation, i.e., "I am not interested in karate anymore." injury, i.e., "I was injured during training or competition"; and for other details, the adolescents were allowed to write their own reasons. In order to compare anger scores of "stayer" and "quitter" groups at the start or end of the study, independent t-test was used, and paired t-test was used to study the changes of anger score with time. SPSS software (version 13) was used for data analysis; and p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
