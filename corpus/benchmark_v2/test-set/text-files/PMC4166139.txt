Measures of organisational network analysis will be used to provide information about which organisations are linked, the number of links in the network, the types of interactions between organisations (eg, exchanging information, referrals and planning), and the level and strength of each relationship. 34 35 Maps displaying the patterns of connections between organisations will be generated utilising the UCINET software. 36 The visual and detailed nature of organisational network maps serves as a powerful heuristic device for discussion about the structure of the network, about which services are linked and on which activities. See online supplementary appendix 2 for a hypothetical map.
Framework analysis will be used to explore the present linkage strategies and management gaps, barriers and enablers between mental health, aged care, primary care and social care services, and how these affect people's help seeking experience and journey. Framework analysis is a qualitative method that is suited to applied research with specific questions, a limited timeframe, a predesigned sample, and a priori issues that are to be explored. 38 TheNVivo software package will be used to manage and assist analysis of the qualitative data. 39
