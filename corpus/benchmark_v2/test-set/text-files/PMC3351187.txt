The unwinding assay was basically carried out according to the literatures for RNA helicases (36,37). 5 0 -32 P-labeled transcript 8 and non-labeled transcript 9 were annealed to prepare the duplex substrate for RlmKL. In this experiment, one guanosine residue was added to 5 0 -end of transcript 8 for efficient in vitro transcription. Annealing was performed in 8 ml aliquot containing 200 mM NH 4 OAc, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 3 mM MgCl 2 , 6 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 2 pmol transcript 8, 2 pmol transcript 9 and 5 0 -32 P-labeled transcript 8 (220 000 cpm) as a tracer. The mixture was heated at 90 C for 1 min and stood at room temperature for 20 min. After 3 min pre-incubation at 30 C, 0.8 ml of the mixture was mixed with 19.2 ml solution containing 200 mM NH 4 OAc, 70 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 3 mM MgCl 2 , 60 mM KCl, 6 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) 1 mM Ado-Met, 4 pmol non-labeled transcript 8 and 10 mg of RlmKL (100 pmol) or acetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) (B2518 Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 C. At each period of time, 5 ml aliquot was taken and mixed with 1.67 ml of 4 Â quench solution containing 120 mM ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid, 2.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 40% glycerol and bromphenol blue (BPB) and left on ice. The quenched mixtures were analyzed by 15% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (29:1) at 4 C. The gel was exposed to the imaging plate to visualize and quantify the duplex and the unwound single strand by FLA7000 imaging analyzer system (Fujifilm). The plot was fitted to one phase decay equation [dsRNA unwound] = [dsRNA] 0 Á(1Àexp(ÀkÁtime/[dsRNA] 0 )) and the half-life was calculated, using GraphPad PRISM 5 (Graph Pad software).
