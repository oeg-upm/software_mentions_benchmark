The IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 19 for Windows (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data entry and analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to analyze the data. T-test was used to analyze any statistically significant difference between gender, nationality, and brushing habits with prevalence of caries. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to check the significance between age and caries prevalence. The level of significance was set at 0.05. Post hoc test was also used to check for any significant increase, or decrease in dental caries due to increase in age. Inter-examiner agreement was analyzed using Kappa statistics, and a high degree of agreement (Kappa index: 89.7%) was observed between the 2 examiners.
