First we calculate the descriptive statistics for all independent variables for the total sample, as well as two subsamples: those who never experienced a pregnancy scare, and those who experienced a pregnancy scare (Table 2). Independent samples' t-tests indicate whether the independent variables are statistically different in the two subsamples. Next we investigate these characteristics in a multivariate context, using logistic regression for models of experiencing any pregnancy scare, and Poisson regression for models of the number of pregnancy scares (Table 3). Lastly, we estimate hazard models, implemented using logistic regression, to illustrate the relationship between a pregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy (Table 4). All analyses were conducted in Stata 12.1 using the logit, poisson, and xtlogit commands. The hazard models were estimated with xtlogit to account for the clustering effect of multiple journals per respondent. Table 2 shows that, overall, sociodemographic characteristics associated with disadvantage are overrepresented in the subsample of young women who experienced a pregnancy scare. For example, while only 32% of those who did not experience a pregnancy scare are African American, 54% of those who experienced a pregnancy scare are African American. Also, young women with early pregnancy-related experiences are overrepresented in the pregnancy scares subsample.
