Prevalence was estimated for HIV, HBV, HCV, HSV-2 and syphilis. Exact binomial or binomial 95% CIs were calculated for prevalence estimates. Characteristics were compared by registration status using Ï‡ 2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and t test or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. Prevalence ORs were estimated in a univariate analysis. Characteristics associated with syphilis in a univariate analysis ( p<0.20) were evaluated for correlation and entered in a multivariate logistic regression model. Characteristics that were not statistically significant ( p<0.05) in the multivariate model were removed in a stepwise manner, and independent association with syphilis was assessed after adjustment for other variables retained in the model. Double data entry for all questionnaire and laboratory data were conducted at the ICGES. All data management and analyses were conducted using SAS V.9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).
