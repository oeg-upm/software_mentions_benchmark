Isolation and culture of primary CD8 + T cells. CD8 + T cells from 4 -8-wk-old Tcra Ϫ / Ϫ × P14 TCR transgenic (Taconic), C57BL/6J WT, or Tbx21 Ϫ / Ϫ (The Jackson Laboratory) mice were purifi ed ( > 95% purity) by negative selection (Invitrogen) from pooled spleen and lymph node cells. CD8 + T cells from Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ mice on the ICR background were purifi ed by positive selection (Miltenyi Biotec). All mice were maintained in specifi c pathogen-free barrier facilities and used according to protocols approved by the Immune Disease Institute and the Harvard Medical School Animal Care and Use Committees. For stimulation, purifi ed CD8 + T cells were cultured at 10 6 cells/ml (10 ml) in T25 fl asks coated with 1 μ g/ml each of anti-CD3 (clone 2C11) and anti-CD28 (clone 37.51) by pretreatment with 300 μ g/ml goat anti -hamster IgG. After 48 h, cells were removed from the TCR stimulation and recultured at a concentration of 5 × 10 5 cells/ml in media supplemented with 100 U/ml rhIL-2. Every 24 h, viable cells were counted and readjusted to 5 × 10 5 cells/ml with fresh media containing the corresponding amount of rhIL-2. (Fig. S1) ( 12, 13 ). We therefore further fractionated the positively selected CD8 + T cells from Runx3 KO mice into CD8 + CD4 Ϫ SP or CD8 + CD4 + DP cells by separation using anti-CD4 magnetic beads. This yielded a Runx3 KO SP " enriched " population that contained 75% CD8 + CD4 Ϫ cells and a KO DP enriched population that contained 85% CD8 + CD4 + cells (Fig. S1). The cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 for 2 d before removing them from the TCR stimulus and culturing them in media containing 100 U/ml IL-2. As previously reported, TCR-induced proliferation of Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ CD8 + T cells was severely impaired, irrespective of CD4 expression (Fig. S1) ( 12, 13 ). However, the Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ cells showed cell-surface expression patterns indicative of activated cells, including up-regulation of CD25 and CD69 (Fig. S1). As expected from their ability to up-regulate CD25, Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ CD8 + T cells responded to IL-2 supplementation after day 2 and effi ciently expanded until day 6 of the culture period, albeit at slower rates compared with WT cells (Fig. S1). Although a fraction of the KO DP cells silenced CD4 expression after activation, the ratio of SP/DP cells in each enriched population remained constant thereafter, and we did not observe any major diff erences between these two populations throughout the culture period, indicating that in terms of eff ector CTL diff erentiation and under our culture conditions, Runx3 Ϫ / Ϫ CD8 + T cells that also coexpress CD4 are indistinguishable from those that do not. The data presented in Fig. S2 FACS-based cytotoxicity assay. To measure cytotoxicity, EL4 thymoma target cells were loaded with 0 or 1 μ M Gp33 peptide for 2 h before a 2-h coincubation with P14 CD8 + T cells at the eff ector-to-target ratios indicated in the fi gures in 96-well round-bottom plates. After the coincubation period, cells were stained with Annexin V -FITC and anti-CD8 -allophycocyanin. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.); EL4 target cells (CD8-negative events) were gated, and the percentage of Annexin V + target cells was determined.
