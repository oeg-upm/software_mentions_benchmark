Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). All primary analyses,. Chi-square test was used for comparing the differences between the two groups. P,0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate the differences of ventilator parameters between the data from the built-in software and the PowerLab system. The range of agreement was shown with 95% limits of agreement (LoA) that stands for the mean difference Â±1.96 SD. Narrower 95% LoA indicated better agreement.
This is the first randomized controlled trial report to date of using NIV ventilator equipped with built-in software to monitor the ventilator parameters in home setting in stable hypercapnic COPD patients. In order to estimate the accuracy of built-in software in ventilators, data downloaded from software were compared using the PowerLab system. The finding showed that the estimation of leak and pressure was a low mean bias value between built-in software and PowerLab system. Previous study showed that the rate of abnormalities was 66% and leak was the most common abnormality (34.2%) followed by desaturation dips (23.8%) in home NPPV. 19 In addition, studies have further reported that leak increases ineffective trigger, patient-ventilator asynchrony, and hypoventilation in patients. 20-22 In our study, the mean estimation of leak was 37.99 L/min and 87% of the leaks were ,40 L/min, which was greatly lower than the threshold leak influencing the effects of NPPV as reported by previous study, 23 which could ensure the appropriateness of NIV use and reliability of the results.
