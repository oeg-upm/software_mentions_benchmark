All data presented in this paper are the actual untransformed data except log-transformed data used for bacterial count when necessary to best approximate the normal distribution. Except for mortality, all data were analysed using the one-way ANOVA. Mortality data were analysed by chi-square test. Significant means were then elucidated using the Duncan multiple range tests. All statistical tests were conducted at 95% confidence level using SAS program (Version 6.0, SAS Institute Inc, 2003). The results were expressed as means with pooled of standard error of mean (SEM).
