Data were analysed using PASW V.18.0 (SPSS Inc.). Descriptive statistics were used for demographic data. Continuous values reported were medians and ranges due to the large spread of the data. Categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney or Cross tabulation and Pearson's Ï‡ 2 were performed to compare groups. The probability of remaining ventilated between groups was analysed using survival analysis. Adherence to guidelines was reported in counts and percentages. The influence of diagnostic group on guideline adherence was analysed using Pearson's correlation and comparison of means using Student t test. Survey responses were reported in counts and percentages as well as significant themes derived from qualitative data.
