IBM SPSS Statistics release 20.0.0 was used to calculate linear mixed-effects (LME) models with segment, measurement, and their interaction as fixed effects and subjects as a random effect (variance components). Significance was assumed at p < 0.05. The assumptions made were a normal distribution of the raw data and the residuals. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed a normal distribution of ΔT 1 values in the cartilage of the upper ankle joint (p = 0.6, residuals p = 0.9), the lower ankle joint (p = 0.8, residuals p = 0.6), and the knee (p = 0.9, residuals p = 0.4). Data are presented as counts with their SD. Exclusion conditions were ΔT 1 times of < 400 ms and > 1,500 ms. SigmaPlot software version 12.0 was used to plot data. ΔT 1 was the primary outcome measure of this study. An increase in ΔT 1 corresponded to a decrease in the GAG content.
