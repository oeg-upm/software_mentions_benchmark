Results were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), and n indicated the number of arteries. The concentration curve for U-46619 was expressed as percentages of contraction relative to 120 mM KCl. Relaxation values were expressed as the percentage change from the U-46619-induced contraction. To obtain relaxation values for the encapsulated formulations, the relaxation values of empty liposomes were subtracted from the respective liposomal iloprost formulation. Multigroup comparisons were performed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with either Tukey's or Dunnett's (for comparisons to a control group) post hoc test, as appropriate. Comparison between two groups was performed with a Student's t-test. GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used. Values of P0.05 were considered statistically significant.
