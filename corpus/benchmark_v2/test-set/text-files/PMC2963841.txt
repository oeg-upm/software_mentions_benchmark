The results of standardization of the instrument are reported below in terms of reliability and validity. The analyses were done using SPSS ver. 6.0. Reliability Measures : Three measures of reliability were calculated, as follows: Cronbach's Alpha, a measure of internal consistency, calculated for the whole sample (N=155, data for 2 cases missing) separately for Section-I and Section-ll, was 0.9 and 0.67 respectively. Interrater reliability of 3 raters for 9 families was computed. The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) for any single rater was 0.81 and average reliability for all 3 raters was 0.93, indicating good inter-rater reliability. Test-retest reliability was calculated for a sub-sample of families who were evaluated at intake and again after a mean duration of 4.5 months (N=110). Pearson's Yfor Section-I was 0.71 (p<.01) and for Section-ll was 0.36 (p<.01), indicating moderate to high testretest reliability.
