Polycrystalline samples of the A-site-ordered double-perovskite solid solution Ca 1-x La x Cu 3 Fe 4 O 12 (x 5 0.0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and 1.0) were prepared, at 15 GPa and 1300 K, from stoichiometric amounts of Ca 2 Fe 2 O 5 , La 2 O 3 , CuO, Fe 2 O 3 , and the oxidizing agent KClO 4 by using a multianvil press. Synchrotron XRD patterns at temperatures between 100 and 450 K were collected at beamline BL02B2, SPring-8, Japan, with wavelength 0.7737405 Ã… , and the profiles were analyzed with Rietveld method by using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software package 42,43.
