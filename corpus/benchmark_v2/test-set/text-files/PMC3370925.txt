Image capture and processing. All FISH stained samples were analyzed under an Axio Observer Z1 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). LSPP methodology included first, area localization by MosaiX module and subsequent focus correction for each determined quadrant with a 10% of image overlapping. For each quadrant, the number of depth slices was defined using Zstacking module. All quadrants were then joined with Stitching overlapping algorithm. Finally, obtained frames were consecutively organized in one single picture with the Extended Focus module. All modules used are contained in Zeiss AxioVision v4.8.2 software.
