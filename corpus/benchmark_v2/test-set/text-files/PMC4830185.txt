Genotyping and copy number variant detection. Highdensity single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays (HumanCoreExome-12 v1-0; Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used to detect the presence of CNVs from genomic DNA. Arrays were processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. To minimize false-positives, CNVs were called using the Nexus Copy Number package (BioDiscovery Inc, Hawthorne, CA) from signal intensity data after preprocessing in Illumina GenomeStudio Software. In Nexus, systematic array correction files were used with the linear correction model to correct for GC bias, and a significance threshold of 1 3 10 27 was applied. The SNP-FAST2 Segmentation algorithm was used for analysis, with homozygous frequency threshold at 0.95, hemizygous loss threshold at 20.23, and single copy gain at 0.13 for the log R ratio. A total of 184 samples were processed on the arrays. Samples were removed from the project if they had 1 or more of the following: a ,95% call rate (0 samples), a probe-to-probe variability (quality) of .0.1 (15 samples), a sex mismatch (0 samples), and .100 CNVs (34 samples), leaving n 5 144. To avoid false-positives, only variants that contained .12 consecutive altered SNP probes and that were .20 kb in size were analyzed. CNVs showing .90% coverage of variants of a frequency of $0.1% of the same type, reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home), using array comparative genomic hybridization or SNP arrays, were considered copy number polymorphisms and were excluded from further analysis (i.e., CNVs reported in this study are designated as "rare"). CNVs that did not overlap exons of a gene were also excluded. The potential for pathogenicity was based on gene content/disruption, CNV size, frequency, and previous association of genes or regions with epilepsy and related neurologic conditions. Gene products were annotated for Gene Ontology (GO) categories within biological processes and molecular functions using the Gene Ontology Consortium Web tool at http://geneontology.org/.
