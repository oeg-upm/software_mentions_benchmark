More causative gene identifications lie ahead of us With the introduction of higher resolution arrays in routine diagnostics, we can expect an increasing number of very local chromosomal rearrangements to be identified. These small copy number variants detected in patients are submitted to databases, such as DECIPHER, ECARUCA and ISCA, along with phenotypic information [38-44]. A closer look at the data submitted, for instance to DECIPHER, suggests that many more causative gene identifications may lie ahead of us. In this database, currently containing publicly available data from 6,000 patients, about 80 de novo single gene aberrations are present, consisting of 55 deletions and 25 duplications. Using the DAVID annotation tools [45], we found that 55% of these genes are expressed in the brain and 15% are involved in the functioning of the glutamate or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors (unpublished observations). Furthermore, genes involved in neurogenesis, differentiation and coding for developmental proteins are enriched in this set. These data clearly suggest a role for at least some of these small copy number variants in neurological disease.
