To predict protein interaction partners for the C-terminus of S4D, we first created a database of orthologous proteins, defined as the proteins with the smallest average E-value from forward and reciprocal BLAST searches for two species and the largest sequence overlap, from 184 species in the NCBI Entrez database [27], while restricting E-values to those less than 1e-5 and sequence overlap to greater than 80%. Using this ortholog database, we calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient for domain-domain interactions between S4D and PDZ domains found in human proteins using the Mirrortree methodology as described previously [26,28,29]. Briefly, the full protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were broken at the domain start and end positions. These reduced domain MSAs were used as the input for the Mirrortree method, along with the PDZ domains found in all other human proteins.
