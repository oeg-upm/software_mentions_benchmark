After the election, everyone within a group is informed about the IDs of the three delegates who make contribution choices on behalf of their group members for the next three periods. At the end of each single period in Part 4, everyone within a group receives information regarding the delegate ID, the contributions and earnings of each member in her own group, and the total contributions of each of the three groups. To facilitate comparisons, we present subjects in Baseline with exactly the same information without any reference to delegation or elections. Communication is not allowed in either treatment. 7 The experiment was conducted in the MELESSA laboratory at the University of Munich from February to April 2012. A total number of 126 undergraduate and postgraduate (master) students with various academic backgrounds were recruited via ORSEE (Greiner 2015). Subjects remained anonymous throughout the experiment and cash payments were made privately. The experiment was programmed and conducted with the software z-Tree (Fischbacher 2007). An experimental session lasted for a bit less than 2 hours. Subjects earned an average of €22.05 (including a €4 show-up fee).
