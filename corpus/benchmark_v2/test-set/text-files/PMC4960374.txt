Iliac vessels (5 mm length) were homogenized using Tissue Grinder Motor (Bel-Art Products, Wayne, NJ, USA) and lysed with RIPA buffer (Biosesang, Seongnam, Korea) containing a cOmplete Mini, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-free protease inhibitor cocktail ® (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The protein concentrations were measured by bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Iliac artery lysates were loaded and separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto Immuno-Blot ® PVDF Membrane (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked by a 5% skim milk (Noble Bio, Hwaseong, Korea) dilution in Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20 (TBS-T) at room temperature for 1 hour, and were subsequently washed three times in TBS-T. Membranes were incubated in TBS-T with primary antibodies against HMGB1, TNF-α, and RAGE (all 1:1000 in 5% BSA, Biosesang, Seongnam, Korea) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed three times in TBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour. All blots were probed using GAPDH as a loading control. Densitometry analysis was performed with Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are expressed as mean±SEM. Continuous variables were compared using t-test (comparison of two groups) and ANOVA (comparison of 3 or more groups). If data distributions were skewed, a non-parametric test was used for comparison. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
