Finally, nobody appears to have made software code available. The conclusion must be that J-tests have rarely been used in empirical research up to now and that the main bottleneck for practitioners is the lack of freely downloadable software. Hence, besides further developing J-tests, and stating that J-tests are a useful tool to select the right spatial weights matrix and/or spatial econometric model specification, we suggest that the researchers who have been active in this field may have even more impact if they make their software available. This would follow LeSage (2015), who has made available code written in Matlab relating to his Bayesian comparison approach.
