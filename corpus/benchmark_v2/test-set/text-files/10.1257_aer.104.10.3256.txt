The main treatment was run in June 2010 (for Set I) and November 2012 (for Set II) at the CBESS Experimental Laboratory at the University of East Anglia. Participants were recruited from the general student population using the ORSEE system (Greiner 2004), excluding individuals who participated in previous bargaining table experiments. There were 144 subjects in the Set I sessions and 168 in the Set II sessions; no one participated in both. The bargaining protocol was implemented using z-Tree (Fischbacher 2007). Subjects' understanding of this protocol and other key aspects of the experiment was checked using a computerized questionnaire (which can be found in the online Appendix). Sessions lasted between 60 and 80 minutes; earnings ranged between £5 and £25 with an average of £15.12, including a £5 show-up fee.
