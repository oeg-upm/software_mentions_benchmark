According to the orientation of the implanted neck, the cases were divided into 10 groups Table 1). The first postoperative and subsequent consecutive anteroposteriordigital radiographs of each hip were examined retrospectively by two independent blinded observers (E.T, C.P.), neither involved in the clinical care of the patients. Stem subsidence at two years postoperatively was measured by the two observers, as a change in the vertical distance from the proximal tip of the greater trochanter to the shoulder of the stem [8]. A computer-assisted method was used to perform these measurements. The radiographs were originally DICOM and transformed into TIFF greyscale format without compression. These digital images were processed via Roman v1.7 software (Roman software version V1.70; Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, Oswestry, UK; http://www.cookedbits.co.uk/roma n/). Roman is a radiological measurement program designed for orthopaedic applications in general. Its accuracy has already been demonstrated for the measurement of polyethylene wear, where the determination of bone and prosthesis landmarks is automated by the computer using an edge detection algorithm [13]. Roman has also been successfully used in stem migration analyses [14].
Cortical Index (CI), stem alignment and canal fill were also assessed, with the use of Roman v1.7. CI was calculated at a level 100 mm below the middle of the lesser trochanter and Dorr's bone quality for each patient was assigned [15]. Varus or valgus malalignment of the stem was defined as deviation from the longitudinal femoral axis of > 3Â° on the first postoperative radiograph [16]. On the same radiograph, canal fill at four different levels (calcar, lesser trochanter, midstem, distal fill) was measured [17]. Firstly, lesser trochanter level was defined from a line drawn on the anteroposterior radiograph through the midpoint of the lesser throchanter. Three lines parallel to this were then drawn through the diaphysis. One through the medial margin of the neck osteotomy (calcar level), another through the middle of the stem (midstem level) and the last 100 mm distally, at the stem tip area (distal level). Canal fill was calculated as a percentage of the stem diameter to the endosteal diameter at each level [17]. We defined a stem as undersized when midstem fill was 80% [18].
All statistical analyses were performed using the Stata statistical package (Stata Corporation: Stata/SE 11.0 for Windows, Lakeway Drive, College Station, Texas, USA, 2010).
