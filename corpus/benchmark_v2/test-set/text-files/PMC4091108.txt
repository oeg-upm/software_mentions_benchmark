Peak identification and quantification GC-MS chromatograms were analyzed using TurboMass software version 5.4.2 (Perkin Elmer). Peak identifications were achieved using NIST (Natl. Inst. of Standards and Technology) and Wiley 9th edition (John Wiley and Sons, Inc.,) mass spectra database libraries and linear retention index (LRI). The LRI values were calculated using a calibration curve generated by injecting a mixture of alkane (C8-C18) under previously described conditions. The percentage peak areas were calculated by dividing the peak area of each compound by the total area. To fairly compare the relative amount of each compound in different treatments, we normalized the peak areas using trans, trans-2,4-nonadienal as the internal standard (IS). The compounds' amounts were normalized by dividing their peak areas by IS peak area.
