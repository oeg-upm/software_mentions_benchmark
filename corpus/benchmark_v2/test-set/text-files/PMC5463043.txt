A single-stranded DNA template was prepared from 16-18 ÔÅ≠l of the biotinylated PCR product using streptavidin Sepharose HP beads (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) following the PSQ 96 sample preparation guide using multichannel pipettes. Fifteen picomoles of the respective sequencing primer were added for analysis. Sequencing was performed on a PyroMark ID system with a Pyro Gold reagents kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions without further optimization. The methylation percentage was calculated from the average of the degree of methylation at 4 CpG sites formulated in pyrosequencing. The primer sequences are described in Supplementary Table S3. Statistical analysis A paired t-test was used to compare the methylation levels in GC tissues paired with NM. For the analyses of clinical implications, an unpaired t-test was used to analyze methylation levels among each classified groups according to clinicopathological parameters. The significant difference between samples considering the tumor location and TNM stage was calculated using the ANOVA test. Statistical significance was considered at p-value < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V5.0 (GraphPad Software, USA)
