Bold values indicate a significant difference P < 0.05.Design 4.0 (Agena Bioscience Inc.) software was used to design a Multiplexed SNP mass-EXTEND assay. [20] Data analyses and management were conducted by Sequenom Typer 4.0 Software (Agena Bioscience Inc.). [21]
Microsoft Excel and SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) were used to perform statistical analyses. Throughout the document, P values were 2-sided; furthermore, P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The age difference of cases and controls was calculated by Welch t tests, and the exact test was used to determine whether the SNPs departed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The association between the minor allele and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH was evaluated by Pearson x 2 test. To assess the association between each genotype and the risk of alcohol-induced ONFH, 5 models were used, including the codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and log-additive model. Finally, the SHEsis software platform [22] and Haploview software package (version4.2) (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA) were used to analyze the patterns of LD, haplotype construction, and the genetic association at polymorphic loci. [23] Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) could show whether the frequencies between cases and controls had a significant difference. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was adjusted for age. In order to eliminate the probability of falsepositive results, Bonferroni multiple adjustment was applied to the level of significance, which was set at P < 0.0017 (0.05/30).
