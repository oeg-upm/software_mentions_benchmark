The lateral resolution of the probe is 1-2 mm depending on target depth, while the axial resolution is limited by the system's ultrasound bandwidth and is < 0.2 mm. The probe displacement was performed manually, however the peak amplitudes weremeasured and displayed automatically by the system itself. After the blast, new peaks appeared indicating to formation of new areas with blood. The acoustic signal is amplified by a low-noise 40 dB second-stage amplifier and recorded by a high-speed digitizer (NI USB-5132, National Instruments, Austin, TX) at 8 bits resolution and 50 MS/s. The operator interface is a laptop (Dell Precision M4500) running Windows 7 and custom LabVIEW software. The software controls the OPO and analyzes signals in real time to allow for unattended monitoring once the probe is secured.
The rat model is the most commonly used model in the TBI research due to the similarities between TBI in humans and rats and knowledge obtained in numerous rat TBI studies. To demonstrate the feasibility of the blast-induced hematoma formation monitoring with this technique, the rat model was best because the blast-induced TBI has been studied in rats by many groups. Blast-induced TBI in large animals is less reproducible and practical and is not well established yet. All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the UTMB. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 15, weight = 370-520 g) were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane in an induction chamber, intubated and mechanically ventilated with a mixture of 70:30 air:oxygen and 1.5-3% isoflurane (2-3% during surgery, 1.5-2% during monitoring). A tail artery was cannulated for continuous measurement of arterial blood pressure via a Biopac MP-100 system (Biopac Systems, Inc., Goleta, CA). The instantaneous blood pressure (with a sampling interval of 50 ms) was acquired, displayed and logged by AcqKnowledge 3.9 software running on a Macintosh PC. The current mean arterial pressure (MAP, averaged over the last 30 sec) was periodically calculated and entered in the AcqKnowledge journal. Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe. The dorsal surface of the head was shaved, and any remaining hair removed with Nair lotion, to minimize the attenuation of the blast wave, the laser pulses, and the acoustic signals during oxygenation monitoring.
