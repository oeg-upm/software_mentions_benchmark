Approvals were granted by the University of Manitoba Health Research Ethics Board and the Manitoba Health Information Privacy Committee. Individual written consent from patients was not required by the ethics board or the privacy committee for this retrospective analysis using de-identified data.Changes in the treatment of HZ-PHN over time were examined by linear regression (Figure 2). Only anticonvulsant use changed significantly with a 212% increase in the number of anticonvulsant-treated episodes from 1997/98 to 2011/12 (P<0.0001, R 2 =0.92). The duration of treatment for HZ-PHN varied widely between drug classes (Figure 3). The median days supplied was highest for antidepressants (178 days) and anticonvulsants (134 days), with shorter durations for NSAIDs (50 days) and opioids (28 days). The median duration of anticonvulsantThe overall annual cost of opioid, NSAID, and antidepressant prescriptions underwent a moderate increase with antidepressants increasing by 91%, opioids by 67%, and NSAIDs by 35% (Table 2). However, these changes were small compared to the increase in anticonvulsant use, which underwent a 755% rise in class cost, increasing from
