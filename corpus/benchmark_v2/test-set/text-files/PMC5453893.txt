Data are reported as medians (25th-75th percentiles). A P value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance for paired comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed withSPSS software (ver. 19.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and Prism (ver. 5.0; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Twotailed post hoc power analyses were performed with G*Power (ver. 3.1; http://www.gpower.hhu.de) [13]. Graphs were drawn with Prism.C-SIA score for PCA therapy evaluation these, 41 were excluded from the study because of postoperative intensive care unit recovery (5), epidural analgesia treatment (15), methadone PCA (10), and incomplete records (11). Thus, data from 50 patients (16 re-instructed vs. 34 not re-instructed) were extracted from the acute pain service electronic database (Table 1). Table 2 summarizes data collected regarding DD ratios, pain scores, morphine consumption, and SIA and C-SIA scores. The DD ratio decreased significantly from the 24 h to the 48 h visit in re-instructed patients (P = 0.011; mean difference [95% CI] = −0.9 [−1.571 to −0.245]; Fig. 1). Conversely, it did not change in not re-instructed patients (P = 0.427; mean difference [95% CI] = 0.14 [−0.222 to 0.513]). The DD ratio was higher for re-instructed patients than not re-instructed patients 24 h after intervention (P = 0.018), and equal in both groups at 48 h (P = 0.154). Morphine consumption was higher for reinstructed patients at 24 h (P = 0.011) and equal for both groups in the subsequent 24 h (P = 0.511). VNS at rest and movement were higher for re-instructed patients 24 h after surgery (P = 0.024 and P = 0.012, respectively) but not after 48 h (P = 0.173 and P = 0.185). Both SIA and C-SIA scores decreased significantly after re-instruction intervention (P = 0.034 and P = 0.006, respectively). The SIA and C-SIA scores were each significantly different between study groups only at 24 h after intervention Table 2, Fig. 2). In addition, 25% (4/16) of re-instructed patients and 61.8% (13/34) of not re-instructed patients had a negative C-SIA score (P = 0.032).
