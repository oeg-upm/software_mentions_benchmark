After fasting for least 6 h, patients were administered 370 MBq of 18 F-FDG intravenously. All patients were instructed to rest comfortably for 60 min and to urinate before scanning. Wholebody PET-CT images were obtained with a Discovery ST scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Seven to eight frames (3 min per frame) of emission PET data were acquired in 3D mode after a non-contrast CT scan from the base of the skull to the upper thigh (tube rotation time of 1 s per revolution, 120 kV, 60 mA, 7.5 mm per rotation and an acquisition time of 60.9 s for a scan length of 867 mm). Emission PET images were reconstructed using an iterative method (ordered-subsets expectation maximization with 2 iterations and 30 subsets; field of view, 600 mm; slice thickness, 3.27 mm) and attenuation corrected with noncontrast CT. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed 18 F-FDG PET-CT images on an AW workstation (v. 4.4; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) by consensus. Focal 18 F-FDG uptake with intensity higher than that of normal background soft tissue on PET image was considered to be positive for metastasis. CT images were used for anatomic localization, but not for decision making. For the semi-quantitative analysis of 18 F-FDG uptake, standardized uptake values (SUVs) were calculated based on injected dose and body weight. Circular regions of interest were placed on the ALN and maximum SUVs (SUV max ) were recorded. When the lesion could not be visualized owing to a lack of 18 F-FDG uptake, an SUV of zero was recorded.
Multivariate analysis was performed using logistical regression of the variables that were found to be statistically significant on univariate analyses. Analyses were performed using the SPSSÂ® v. 19.0 statistical software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), with a value of p , 0.05 considered to be significant. Table 2).
