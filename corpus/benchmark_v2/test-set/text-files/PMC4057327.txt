The effects of the different factors (pH, feeding ratios, and the cross-link ratios) on the loading parameters were investigated by full factorial design in three levels Table 2). The factors were analyzed using Design-Expert ® Software version 6.02 (Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).
At scheduled times, 1 mL of the medium was withdrawn, and the amount of MTX released was estimated by the HPLC method as described in the section "Remote loading of MTX." The cumulative release percentage of MTX was determined at each point and plotted as a function of time.Notes: The Z-average, PDI, and zeta-potential of the PeI ionomer at different cross-link ratios before and after the removal of Zn 2+ from the micellar templates and following the encapsulation of the MTX in the nano-networks at the feeding ratio of 0.3. *In PBs (10 mM phosphate salts +140 mM Nacl; ph 7.4).The control experiment was done to study free MTX transport through the dialysis membrane at the simulated media. To find out the mechanism of drug release from the nano-networks, the Korsmeyer-Peppas equation (Equation 3) was best fitted for the first 60% drug release data in comparison to other mathematical equations, including zero order, first order, and the Higuchi models. 55 The release rate (k), the release exponent (n), and the lag time (t 0 ) were determined from the fraction of MTX released (M/M ∞ ) versus time (t) by a nonlinear regression method, using SPSS Statistics version16.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
The statistical analysis was performed by GraphPad Software Inc., version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). P-values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
