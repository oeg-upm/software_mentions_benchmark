Statistical analyses were performed using the Dell Statistica data analysis software system, version 13 (Dell, Inc, Round Rock, TX, USA). Statistical testing was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) on continuous variables and appropriate nonparametric tests on categorical data. Statistical significance was set at P=0.05. Vector math was used where appropriate for astigmatism analysis.
