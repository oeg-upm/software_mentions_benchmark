The TI measurement tool used seven questions; for turnover factors, four questions modified and used by Gang 20) were modified and reconstructed for this study. The tool is composed of 11 questions. To measure WS, this study used the questionnaire consisting of 15 questions after modifying and complementing the method used by Byun 13). The WE measurement tool was reconstructed for this study based on the survey tool reconstructed by Lim 21). WE was measured with a questionnaire of 26 questions. Each question on the measurement tool was based on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (strongly agree) points and higher scores meant better WE. Cronbach's alpha values in a previous and the present study were more than 0.700.SPSS 18.0 was used for the collected data and the analysis method is as follows. Participants' general characteristics were shown as frequency and percentage. TI, WS, and WE of the participants were obtained as means and standard deviations. The data were analyzed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient to verify the reliability of questionnaire internal consistencies. The correlation between TI, WS, and WE used correlation analysis through Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis to determine the impact of WS and WE on TI 2) . The significance level of this study was set as 0.05.
