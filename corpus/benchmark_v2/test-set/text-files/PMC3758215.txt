Statistical evaluation was conducted with SPSS (v17.0;SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The patients were divided into two groups according to the CRP measured preoperatively: those with CRP values in the normal range (#10 mg/L) and those with elevated CRP levels (.10 mg/L). The Pearson Chi-squared test was used to determine the significance of differences between the two groups. The overall cumulative probability of survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference was assessed by the log-rank test. A univariate analysis was used to examine the association between various prognostic predictors and survival. Possible prognostic factors associated with overall survival were considered in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (Enter). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to quantify the strength of the association between predictors and survival. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
