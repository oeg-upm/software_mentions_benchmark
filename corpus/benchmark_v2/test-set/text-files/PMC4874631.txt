CT images data were reconstructed at 1-mm-thick sections with a reconstruction increment of 1 mm and a sharp kernel (B70f). They were transferred to a personal computer running MevisPULMO software (version 1.4, Fraunhofer MEVIS, Bremen, Germany) and analyzed for quantitative emphysema assessment by one operator (NS). A 3Ã—3 kernelbased axial Gauss smoothing was applied to minimize the noise in sharp kernel images. For the whole lung, emphysema extent was defined as percentage of lung voxels #-950 Hounsfield units. 14
A two-tailed P-value ,0.05 was always considered as significant. SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all the statistical analysis.
