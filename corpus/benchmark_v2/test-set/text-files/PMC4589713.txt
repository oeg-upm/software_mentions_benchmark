The mold consisted of a base was scored with 3 horizontal lines perpendicular to 2 vertical lines with each 0.050 mm wide. 3.8 mm internal diameter steel ring was positioned accurately on the base and perforated steel plate was used to apply pressure after loading elastomers. Initially, the metal ring was placed on the base of the mold fallowed by direct injection of light body material onto platform. Then tray material was mixed and loaded according to manufacturer instruction. Excess materials were removed through perforation. The specimens were allowed to set in thermostatically controlled water bath at 37°C to simulate oral condition. Total of 30 specimens with 10 for each group (materials) were fabricated. After fabricating the samples, the distance between the inner profiles of horizontal line was measured (0.005 mm) using microscope before and after subjecting to disinfection with autoclave (Group-1), chemical -1% sodium hypochlorite (Group-2), and microwave (Group-3) methods by same examiner. Mean values were tabulated and analyzed using t-test and SPSS software IBM version 21. The percentage of dimensional change was assessed using formula; dimensional change % = (A-B)/A × 100, where "A" is distance between the inner profile of horizontal line before disinfection and "B" is after disinfection procedure.
