Artificial neural network and LR models were computed using the MATLAB-software and the Neural Network Toolbox (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Each ANN (feed forward network with error back propagation) had three layers: input layer with four neurons, hidden layer with two neurons and output layer with one neuron representing the nonBCR probability. Follow-up data after LRP were collected every 6 months and respectively added into the separate models. Every 6 months separate models (ANN and LR) were calculated with those patients still not having a BCR at this time-point (those with a BCR earlier were excluded) and those who were not censored. For all models, internal validation was performed with the leave one out method.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) and MedCalc 12.4.0 (MedCalc Software, Mariakerke, Belgium) to compare all variables using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses regarding sensitivity, specificity and areas under ROC curve (AUC). The comparison of ROC curves were performed with the method of Delong and the comparison of prediction results were conducted using Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for ordinal variables. Differences were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. Table 1 displays the patient characteristics as well as the distribution of clinico-patholological parameters of the BCR and nonBCR group. There were no relevant differences between the two groups for age (P = 0.37), PSA (P = 0.12), %fPSA (P = 0.26), prostate volume (P = 0.33), and PSA density (P = 0.11). In contrast, the pathological GS, margin status, and pT were different between the BCR and nonBCR group except for GS =7 (P = 0.12), as shown in Table 1.
