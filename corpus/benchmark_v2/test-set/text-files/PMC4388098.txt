Asmus-szepesi et al were analyzed using logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, ISAR-HP score, baseline score of the studied outcome variable, and admission diagnosis. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression. All analyses were performed using SPSS software (v 21.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Missing values for costs were assumed to be missing at random, conditional on observed baseline characteristics and outcome variables. 28 Thus, we performed a multiple imputation procedure with predictive mean matching, generating five completed datasets including a rich set of baseline variables (eg, age, sex, ISAR-HP score) and accounting for death and length of survival. The medical ethics committee of the Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands approved the study protocol under protocol number MEC2011-041.
