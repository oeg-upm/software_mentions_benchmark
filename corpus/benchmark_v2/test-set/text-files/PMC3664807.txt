Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 C. Fixation was performed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. During the last minute, few drops of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS were added to the cells. Afterwards cells were washed three times in PBS with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 min at room temperature, followed by 5 min in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. Finally, cells were washed with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween20) twice for 5 min at room temperature and stored at 4 C. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 37 C. Cells were washed in PBS-T three times for 5 min before antibody staining. Afterwards they were incubated with the primary antibody in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-T for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Cells were then again washed in PBS-T three times for 3 min and incubated with the suitable secondary antibody in 4% BSA in PBS-T for 1 h. After washing with PBS-T twice for 5 min, the DNA was counterstained with 50 ng/ml of DAPI in PBS-T for 5 min. Slides were rinsed again in PBS-T and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector). For detection of Tip5, cells were fixed in methanol and acetone as previously described (15) and then processed as described earlier in the text. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope using the Axio Vision software.
