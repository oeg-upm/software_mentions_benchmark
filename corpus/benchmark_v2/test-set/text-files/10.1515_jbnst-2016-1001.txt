Access to the BHP is only possible via on-site use at the FDZ and remote data processing. For on-site use, the FDZ provides several workplaces for visiting researchers within a secure computing environment at different locations in Germany and abroad (Bender/Heining 2011). 6 For remote data processing, researchers submit scripts to the FDZ that execute commands for data preparation and analysis. The scripts are processed on secure servers within the FDZ and the results are transferred to the researchers after a disclosure review. Remote data processing at the FDZ is conducted via the Job Submission Application (JoSuA) developed by the Institute for the Study of Labour (IZA), which allows users to submit jobs and access their results via a custom-built web interface (see Eberle et al. forthcoming). Researchers intending to use the BHP are required to apply for data access via on-site use and remote data processing at the FDZ. Access can be granted to non-commercial research institutions conducting research projects in the fields of employment research.
