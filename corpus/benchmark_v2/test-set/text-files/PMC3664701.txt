Single-channel current transitions were identified using the algorithm described previously (Andersen, 1983), implemented in software written in Visual Basic (Microsoft Corp.). Single-channel lifetimes () were determined by fitting single exponential distributions to survivor histograms of the lifetime distributions using Origin 6.1 (OriginLab). At least 300 channels were collected in each experiment. Changes in appearance frequency ( f ), the number of channels (opening followed by closing events) per unit of time, were determined only in experiments in which the bilayer remained intact after adding the phospholipid. The results were reported as means ± SD; in case there were only two observations, the results were reported as means ± range. Relative changes in appearance frequency were determined by normalizing the appearance frequency in the first two recordings right after the 10-min incubation Figure 1. Structures of the phospholipids used in this study; brain PIP 2 is predominantly 1-C 18:0 -2-C 20:4 -PI(4,5)P 2 , which is shown in the figure.
All data plots and statistical analyses were performed in Origin 6.1. One population Student's t test was used to establish whether means were significantly different from 1 as indicated by asterisks (P ≤ 0.05). Two population, two-tailed, independent Student's t tests were used to establish whether two means were significantly different (P ≤ 0.05). A one-way ANOVA test performed on all compared means indicated significant differences (P ≤ 0.05).
