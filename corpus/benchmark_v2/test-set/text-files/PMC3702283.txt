Behavioural analysis. Behavioural analysis was performed to assess the development of tactile allodynia in mice. Tactile allodynia was measured using a von Frey filament (North Coast Medical, Gilroy, CA, USA). Mice were placed in glass cages with a wire mesh bottom and allowed to habituate for at least 1 h. A von Frey filament with bending forces of 0.16 g (innocuous stimulation) was pressed perpendicularly against the plantar skin of a hind-paw. The paw withdrawal responses to the mechanical stimulus were evaluated by scoring as follows: 0, no response; 1, lifting the hind-paw within 3 s; 2, lifting the hind-paw over 3 s; and 3, immediate flinching or licking of the hind-paw. The stimulation of the same intensity was applied seven times to each hind-paw at several seconds intervals and the total served as the pain-related score (score) in the SNL model. The behavioural data were analyzed using Origin (Microcal software Inc., Sunnyvale, MA, USA) software to determine the IC 50 values.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from substantia gelatinosa neurons. The substantia gelatinosa was easily discernible with transmitted illumination as a relatively translucent band across the dorsal horn in the transverse or parasagittal slice preparations. Blind whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from SG neurons, as previously described. 53,54 The patch pipettes were filled with potassium gluconate solution, a solution containing (in mM); 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, and 5 ATP-Mg (pH 7.2). The tip resistance of the patch pipettes was 6-12 MO. Series resistance was assessed from current in response to a 5-mV hyperpolarizing step. Series resistance was monitored during the recording session and data were rejected if its value changed by 415%. Ion currents were monitored with a patchclamp amplifier (Axopatch 700A, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The data were digitized with an analog-to-digital converter (Digidata 1321A, Molecular Devices), stored on a personal computer using a data acquisition program (Clampex version 10, Molecular Devices) and analyzed using a software packageClampfit version 10 (Molecular Devices). Recordings were made in a voltageclamp mode at holding potential of Ã€ 70 mV to isolate EPSCs. Drugs were dissolved in the Krebs solution and applied by superfusion.
