Content Validity Index (CVI) was used to assess the relevance of each question using a 4-point scale: 4=highly relevant, 3=relevant with minor adjustments, 2=minimally relevant and 1=not relevant. For the construct validity of the questionnaire the technique of factor analysis with the rotation method of axes was applied (Equamax by normalizing by Kaiser). Repeatability was evaluated by the method McNemar-Bowker. Internal consistency of the questionnaire was calculated through Cronbach's a coefficient while the significance level was set up at 5%. Quantitative variables are described as mean (Â± Standard Deviation) and qualitative variables as absolute frequencies and relative frequencies. The statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version20 (SPSS Inc., 2003, Chicago, USA).
