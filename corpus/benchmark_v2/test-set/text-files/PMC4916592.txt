All data were analysed using SPSS V.22.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) or GraphPad Software. Descriptive statistics were used to display all variables, using means and SDs for continuous variables or proportions for categorical variables. Prevalence with 95% CIs were calculated using a modified Wald method for outcome variables. 40 χ 2 or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test differences between hospitals for categorical variables and t-tests or analysis of variance to test differences between hospitals for continuous variables. 41 Univariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to test for crude associations with the outcomes. 41-43 Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse for independent associations. 42 43 As this study was investigating a new field, a data-driven backwards stepwise method was chosen. 42 43 All variables achieving crude associations ( p<0.2), except those deemed illogical, were entered into the backwards stepwise model, nonsignificant variables ( p>0.05) were removed at each step, until only variables achieving statistical significance remained ( p<0.05) and their ORs reported (unadjusted model). 42 43 This model method was consistent with similar foot-related studies. 31 36 44-46 Collinearity was tested for all models using correlation matrix (>0.9), tolerance (<0.1) and variance inflation factor (>10). 42 43 If collinearity was identified, the variable with the lowest OR in the univariate analysis was removed. The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit, Omnibus and Negelkerke pseudo R 2 tests were used at each step of all models to indicate goodness of fit, significance, parsimony and potential variance of the outcome variable explained by the model, respectively. 42 43 The final unadjusted model was then tested for confounding by re-entering in each non-included explanatory variable to see if it confounded the independent explanatory variables in the unadjusted model. 42 43 A confounder was defined, and remained in the model, as changing the β effect estimates of at least one unadjusted independent explanatory variables by >20% (adjusted model). 42 Two different multivariate models were assessed for each outcome variable. The first used all available explanatory variables, except the summarised foot risk status variable (model 1). The second used the summarised foot risk status variable, instead of foot disease history, foot risk factors and foot disease explanatory variables (model 2). Missing data were treated by excluding cases with missing data as missing data were minimal (<5% in all models). 42 Lastly, κ for dichotomous variables, weighted κ (wK) for ordinal variables and intraclass correlation (ICC; models 2 and 1) for continuous variables were used to test for measures of agreement for the data collector testing and audit. 41 47 48 κ and wK (SEs ) strengths were categorised as: no agreement <0; slight agreement=0-0.20; fair agreement=0.21-0.40; moderate agreement=0.41-0.6; substantial agreement=0.61-0.8 and near-perfect agreement=0.81-1.0. 41 47 48 ICC (SD) strengths were categorised as: weak-moderate agreement <0.75 and strong agreement >0.75. 41
