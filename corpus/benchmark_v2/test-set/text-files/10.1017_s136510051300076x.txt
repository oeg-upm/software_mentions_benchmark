An electronic version of the journal is published just prior to the paper version at journals.cambridge.org/mdy. Access to the full-text articles of the electronic version will be limited to institutional subscribers of the hard copy version of the journal, with access available to all online users at that institution's registered domain. Tables of Contents, abstracts, searching and alerting services will remain free of charge. To view the full text of Macroeconomic Dynamics, you will need to use the Adobe Acrobat Reader software. If you do not have a copy already, you can get it free of charge. Just follow the link from our Cambridge Journals Online home page, download it, and install it as a plug-in helper application for your browser.
