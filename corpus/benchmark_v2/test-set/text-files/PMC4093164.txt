Y ij = +C i +d of age at harvest+A j +e ij where,  is overall mean, C i is the fixed effect of i th contemporary group that was defined as combinations of year, season, testing place and harvest date (327 levels),  is the coefficient for linear regression on days of age at harvest, A j is the random additive genetic effect of j th animal, and e ij is measurement error. Basic statistics were analyzed with SAS 9.02 (SAS institute, 2010), and genetic parameters were estimated with ASReml (Gilmour et al., 1999). Selection indices for performance and progeny tests were as follows, respectively.* EMA = Eye muscle area; MS9 = Marbling score with 9 levels. ** SD = Standard deviation. (Table 2). Yoon et al. (2002) had reported with 1,262 carcass records from 334 steer progeny of Hanwoo young bulls that overall means were 301.134.3 kg, 74.88.7 cm 2 , 7.33.2 mm, and 3.041.60 in CW, EMA, BF, and MS, respectively. Yearling weight is one of the traits used to select young bulls, where there is a positive correlation with BF, CW and EMA. It results in improvements in YW, CW and EMA, but negative effects in BF (Table 5). The marbling scoring system was changed from 7 levels to 9 levels since 2005, thus causing higher scores than the past. Son et al. (1997) have reported that least square mean of YW was estimated at 232.083.22 kg in the Hanwoo cow population from 1989 to 1995. Although it was estimated in the cow population, about 50% in YW has been improved for last two decades comparing to the result in this study (352.838.56 kg). Oikawa et al. (2000) have reported that means of EMA, BF and MS were 46.75.9 cm 2 , 16.14.6 mm, 2.491.01, respectively, in Japanese Black (Wagyu) cattle population.
