At flowering time, a small amount of pollen was collected from six anthers of each bud, mixed, and then stained with 1% (w/v) acetocarmine solution. Lengths of short axes of pollen grains (100-400) were microscopically measured using Image-Pro PLUS (Media Cybernetics Co., Ltd., Bethesda, MD, USA). In the control and N 2 O-treated plants of 'Yelloween', microspore tetrad sizes were measured from young anthers of 30-35 mm floral buds. Pollen fertility was determined using the acetocarmine method, whereby acetocarmine-stained pollen was regarded as fertile pollen. Before pollination, the germinability of the pollen obtained by N 2 O treatment was assessed after culture for 24 h at 25Â°C in agar medium containing 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.7% (w/v) agar, 0.3 g/L calcium nitrate and 10 mg/L boric acid.
For data analysis, a non-parametric multiple comparison method (Steel-Dwass test) was performed using Microsoft Excel 2003 and statistical add-in software (Excel Toukei 2010 for Windows, Social Survey Research Information Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
