Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and P values <0.05 (2-sided) indicated statistical significance. We log 10 transformed variables with a skewed distribution to achieve a normal distribution. Basic characteristics were presented as mean AE standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables depending on normality, or proportions for categorical variables. To test for trend of characteristics across BPA quartiles, BPA was modeled as an ordinal variable coding with regard to its quartiles as 1, 2, 3, and 4. We used linear regression model and logistic regression model to test P values for trend for continuous variables and dichotomous variables, respectively.
