The algorithms were incorporated into a custom Matlab (R2014b version 8.4.0.150421, MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA, USA) application with a graphical user interface allowing the user to visually inspect the trajectory traversed by the capsule and select landmarks corresponding to the hepatic flexure, splenic flexure, and descending-sigmoid junction. Hereby, segmental colonic transit times could be calculated. In Figure 2, an example of a 3D trajectory visualized in the graphical user interface is shown.
Baseline-corrected data from the BFI questionnaire were analysed with a paired t test. Data from the GSRS questionnaire were baseline-corrected and analysed in a two-way ANOVA with factors treatment (oxycodone and placebo) and questionnaire dimension (abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea, and constipation). Data from the PAC-SYM and BSFS questionnaires and pain detection thresholds were baseline-corrected and analysed with twoway ANOVAs with factors treatment (oxycodone and placebo) and day (days 2, 3, 4, and 5). For all ANOVAs, Tukey's post hoc test was applied where relevant. Transit time data were non-parametric, and are presented as medians and ranges. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare segmental transit times during the 2 treatments. Spearman's rho was used to identify associations between questionnaire scores and transit times. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using Stata
