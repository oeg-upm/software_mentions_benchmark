Mice were killed by CO 2 asphyxiation; then tissue was quickly harvested and fixed overnight at room temperature with Z-fix solution (Anatech LTD, Battle Creek, MI). Tissues were processed by using a Leica (Buffalo Grove, IL) ASP300S Tissue Processor, paraffin embedded, and cut into 5-μm sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a Dako Autostainer Plus (Dako North America, Inc, Carpinteria, CA) or Discovery Ultra XT autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems Inc, Tucson, AZ) and counterstaining with hematoxylin. Dual immunohistochemistry for CK19 and amylase was performed without counterstaining. Picrosirius red staining was performed per the manufacturer's instructions (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA). Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed by using Mayer's hematoxylin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and Eosin Y (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). Immunofluorescence was performed as previously described. 45 Immunohistochemistry slides were scanned on a Pannoramic SCAN slide scanner (Perkin Elmer, WA), and then annotation regions encompassing greater than 1 mm of tissue were processed by using appropriate algorithms for each stain quantified by using Halo software (Indica Labs, Corrales, NM). Immunofluorescence was quantified by manual counting of 5 fields per slide from images obtained on a Nikon A-1 confocal instrument at ×60 by using NIS-Elements software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY).
Lysates were quantified by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA), and equal protein amounts were run onto sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. Proteins were transferred from sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels to Immobilon-FL polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked, and then incubated with primary antibodies. After washing, membranes were then incubated in secondary antibody, washed, and then exposed on autoradiography film (Bioexpress, Kaysville, UT) with West Pico ECL (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) or scanned on an Odyssey CLx scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Quantitation of Western blots was performed by using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).
Statistics were performed by using Graph Pad Prism 6 (Graph Pad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA) by using an unpaired Student t test for comparison between 2 groups or a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey multiple comparison test.
