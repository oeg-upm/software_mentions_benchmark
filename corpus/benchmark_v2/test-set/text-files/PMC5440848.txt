Linear μFEA was used to calculate apparent biomechanical properties at each site. Homogeneous mechanical properties were assumed for all bone elements. The binary image data set was converted to a mesh of voxels (isotropic) using a conversion technique (Müller and Rüegsegger, 1995), and each element was assigned an elastic modulus of 6.829 GPa (Boyd, 2008) and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3 (van Rietbergen et al., 1996). Cortical and trabecular bone elements were labeled as different materials, with identical material properties to facilitate calculation of compartmental load distribution. A uniaxial compression test in the axial direction (superior-inferior) was performed with an applied uniaxial compressive strain of 1%. An iterative solver (Scanco FE soft- ware v.1.15; Scanco Medcal AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) was used to compute reaction forces at the proximal and distal ends of the scan region for the proscribed displacements. For each model, stiffness (K), apparent modulus (E), and the load fraction for the cortical compartment at the distal boundary (Ct.LF dist) and the proximal boundary (Ct.LF prox) were calculated. Furthermore, failure load (F) was estimated using methods previously described by Mueller et al. (2011).
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
