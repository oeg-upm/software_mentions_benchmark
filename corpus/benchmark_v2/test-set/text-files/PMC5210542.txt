Previously, we have presented QmRLFS-finder, a tool using an updated quantitative model of RLFS (QmRLFS) model that has predicted the RLFS locations in ∼75% of the human genes (22). This tool allowed a higher accuracy, precision and strand specificity of the QmRLFSbased predictions of the R-loops in the proximal promoter and downstream transcription termination site regions (7,20). Soon after the publication of the R-loopDB, the DNA:RNA immune-precipitation coupled to highthroughput sequencing (DRIP-seq) data became available (9,23). Ginno et al. (9) have improved the initial DRIP-seq method (23) and reported detection of 4181 RNA:DNA hybrid regions. In (22), we reported that RLFS predicted byQmRLFS-finder overlapped with 79.2% of DRIP-seq regions defined by Ginno et al. (9). In a comparison of the frequencies of experimentally defined R-loops with those RLFSs predicted by QmRLFS-finder, our tool showed 91% accuracy, 94% sensitivity and 75% specificity (22).
The new version of R-loopDB, based on the predictions by QmRLFS-finder (22), includes several key improvements and extensions that facilitate exploration of the RLFS analysis. We updated the identification of RLFSs in the human genome and provided for the first time the genome-scale prediction of RLFSs in seven additional organisms. The updated R-loopDB allows the user to search for gene(s) containing RLFSs not only in genic regions but also in 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking sequence of the gene, termed 'RLFS-positive genes'. Compared to the previous R-loopDB version, we now use Ensembl gene annotation system that contains information on protein coding genes, pseudogenes, long noncoding RNA genes and short noncoding RNA genes (25). Mapping of RLFSs and other genomic regulatory sequences is graphically visualized in Gbrowse 2 (26) and UCSC genome browser (27). In the case of the human and mouse genomes, the experimentally detected RNA:DNA hybrid data (9,12,14,24) on the genome scale were integrated into the genomics viewers. That allows users to carry out comprehensive comparative analyses of the predicted and experimentally detected RLFSs. Based on the provided results, users can narrow down their target and pick the most plausible sequence of the R-loop forming region.
We collected all genome assembly data from the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/) (27). The human genome hg19 (NCBI build GRCh37) was used as the reference genome in this database. We also analyzed genomic data of selected model organisms including Mus musculus (mm10), Rattus norvegicus (rn5), Pan troglodytes (panTro4), Gallus gallus (galGal4), Xenopus tropicalis (xenTro3), Drosophila melanogaster (dm5) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (saccer3). Only the reference chromosomes were used in this study. Therefore, we excluded other sequence regions such as unlocalized and unplaced scaffolds, supercontigs, assembly patches and alternate loci (haplotypes). Gene annotation data for these organisms was retrieved directly from MySQL server of BioMart database build 75 (ensembl mart 75; http://www.ensembl.org/info/ data/mysql.html) (25). Genomic information of the gene structures for these organisms (GTF format) was downloaded from Ensembl Release 75 (http://feb2014.archive. ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/; accessed 1 April 2016).
We predicted R-loop structures on both strands of genomic DNA using QmRLFS-finder (22). After obtaining RLFSs, we collected RLFSs located in the genic region and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of each gene usingBEDTools (28). RLFSs that overlapped by at least one nucleotide were merged into unique RLFS clusters. When no further RLFSs overlapped the long merged sequence, then this sequence, called an RLFS-merged region, has reached its maximum length. Such regions were reported, counted and made visible in the updated R-loopDB.
R-loopDB currently covers eight organisms, including human, mouse, rat, chimpanzee, chicken, frog, fruit fly and yeast. Supplementary Table S1 provides information on the genome assemblies of these species. Using QmRLFS- finder (22), we significantly extended the list of RLFSs and RLFS-positive genes in the human genome compared to the previous version (18). The summary statistics of RLFSs, RLFS-merged regions and RLFS-positive genes presented in the previous and updated R-loopDBs are shown in Table 1. For instance, 511 651 RLFSs (or 169 222 RLFSmerged regions) were computationally predicted in genic regions and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the genes, whereas, in the previous R-loopDB, 245 181 RLFSs (or 140 106 RLFS-merged regions) were found in the UCSC-defined gene regions. In total, R-loopDB provides chromosome coordinates, sequences and genomic data of 1565 795 RLFSs distributed across 121 056 genes and 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking region of the genes of eight organisms.
Using the Ensembl gene annotation system (25) in RloopDB, RLFS-positive genes can be classified into 93 454 protein-coding genes, 7 554 pseudogenes, 12 480 long noncoding RNA genes and 7 568 short non-coding RNA genes Table 2).
Visual tools for RLFS search could be used for locating putative R-loops in a specific region of genic or gene-proximal regions for further experimental design and validation of the computational prediction(s). Here, we redesigned the interface of R-loopDB to search genes containing RLFS in multiple organisms with a single search. The genes containing RLFS can be retrieved from the database using several search options, e.g. keywords, Ensembl gene ID or Ensembl transcript ID, gene symbol, gene description, Entrez ID, Refseq ID, gene biotype and synonyms (Figure 1A). Note that the keywords option will search the query input string against all terms in the database. The gene search query returns RLFS-positive genes (Figure 1of the particular gene. Each RLFS-merged region has useful information for supporting the R-loop forming potential, such as (i) the number of RLFSs, and (ii) strand and (iii) statistics of the GC skew value. To find RLFS candidates for experimental validation, we recommend that users consider the information in the RLFS-merged region table (Figure 1C.ii). The first one is the 'number of RLFSs'. A higher number of RLFSs in the RLFS-merged region implies a higher propensity of R-loop initiation and formation in a given locus. The second one is 'strand'. According to the R-loop definition where a nascent RNA is hybridized with a DNA template, predicted RLFS are located on the same strand as the transcribed gene Supplementary Figure S1). The third one is 'statistics of GC skew value'. GC skew value was calculated at the whole genomic scale, as shown in Figure 2c. The 'statistics of GC skew value' show statistics of GC skew value in each RLFS-merged region including minimum, maximum, mean and median. GC skew maximum values > 0.1 (for plus strand) or GC skew minimum values < −0.1 (for minus strand) are considered Grich regions (21). The more G-rich an RLFS-merged region is, the more likely it is to increase the thermodynamic stability of R-loop formation (24). In the case of the human and mouse genomes, 'DRIP/RDIP support' and 'DRIPc support' columns, which indicate the number of RNA:DNA hybrid detection experiments for each RLFS-merged region, are provided. There are at least nine RNA:DNA hybrid detection experiments including four DRIP-seq studies in Ntera2, one DRIP-seq in K562, one DRIP-seq in primary fibroblast cells (9,12,14), two RDIP-seq studies in IMR-90 and HEK293T cells (24) and one DRIPc-seq in Ntera2. Individually, these experiments showed variations in the sequence overlap region boundaries, their locations and the sequence cluster overlap peak heights, however, collectively they often demonstrate the patterns converged on the theoretical predictions. A combination of computational predictions and biological data sets suggests a role of NEAT1-associated R-loops in an aberrant NEAT1 transcription initiation and/or 3-end elongation isoform syntheses, leading to modulation of the paraspeckle formation and cell malignancy.
The top panel of the 'Genomic Location' result shows gene name, gene location, strand and cytoband information of the particular gene (see in Figure 2). New genomics visualization has been integrated into R-loopDB using embedded Gbrowse2. The genomics viewer provides visualization of RLFS-merged, RLFS, CpG Island, GC skew profile, Ensembl genes, Ensembl transcripts, DRIP-seq profile, RDIPseq profile and DRIPc-seq profile in a particular genic region as well as in 2 kb upstream and downstream flanking regions of the gene. In Figure 2 Remark: the initial release database provides RLFSs only in genic regions, where the updated database provides RLFSs in genic regions and 2 kb up/downstream region of genes.
The updated R-loopDB could be utilized not only as a predictive model resource but also as an analytical tool to predict and validate many RLFS-positive genes (as coding and non-coding for proteins), pseudogenes to test the specific hypotheses in R-loop biology, to improve the existing methods, to design new experimental studies and to provide an adequate interpretation of the experimental and theoretical results. In those contexts, a combination of R-loopDB and QmRLFS-finder web server (identifying RLFSs in nonannotated and artificial targeting sequences) might be useful.
