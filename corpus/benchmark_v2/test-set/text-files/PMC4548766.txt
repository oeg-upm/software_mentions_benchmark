The data were analyzed using RevMan 5.2 software. We analyzed dichotomous variables using odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and analyzed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) along with 95% CIs. The I 2 and P-value were used for evaluation of heterogeneity. A fixed-effects model was used when the heterogeneity test showed better homogeneity (P.0.1). 10,11 Otherwise, a random-effects model was used. With regard to outcomes when significant heterogeneity existed across studies, sensitivity analysis was conducted by respectively omitting each study to explore the influence of each individual study on the merged data.
