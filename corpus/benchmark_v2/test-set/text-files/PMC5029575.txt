The dose proportionality for loxapine was examined across the dose groups using the power model (linear regression of log AUC inf vs log dose). A slope of 1.00 would indicate "perfect" dose proportionality (double the dose Â¼ double the exposure). Because within this study, the dose range was only 2-fold (30 vs 15 mg), an additional power analysis was done including the 16-fold dose range (10 vs 0.625 mg) from the single-dose study. 20 Statistical analyses and preparation of summary tables and graphics were performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS, version 9.1.3 for Windows) and SAS JMP (version 9.0.0 for Windows). No imputation of missing data was performed.
