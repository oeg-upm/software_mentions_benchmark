This is a 52-item self-report measure intended to assess the functionality of bipolar patients during symptomatic periods or recovery. Aydemir et al 29 developed the questionnaire that consists of eleven subscales, including emotional functioning, intellectual functioning, sexual functioning, stigmatization feelings, social withdrawal, household relations, relations with friends, participation in social activities, daily activities and hobbies, initiative taking, self-sufficiency, and occupation. Because the cut-off score could not be calculated, it was recommended for use in comparative studies. 29 statistical analysis "SPSS for Windows 8.0" (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data analysis. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between categorical variables. After testing for homogeneity and normality of variances, Student's t-test was performed to evaluate the difference between temperament and impulsivity. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey post hoc test were performed to evaluate the patient subgroups. Results were evaluated at 95% confidence interval and significance was evaluated at P,0.05.
