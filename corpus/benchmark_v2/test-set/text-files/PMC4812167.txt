Combination proliferation assay. The cytotoxic effect of TMZ or/and MET on GSCs was measured by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Briefly, U87 and C6 gliospheres were cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates (5x10 3 per 100 µl per well) in NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, 2 µg/ml heparin and 20 ng/ml EGF+bFGF at 37˚C for 24 h, then different concentrations of TMZ (0-3.2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) or MET (0-160 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich) were added and compared with the DMSO-treated control. The CCK-8 reagent (10 µl/well) was added at 93 h, and the OD was measured at 450 nm after 96 h using a Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). In order to determine the combination cytotoxic effect on GSCs, parallel studies were performed in cells treated with TMZ (0-3.2 mmol) plus MET (0-160 mmol) (1:50, TMZ:MET). The combination index (CI) value was analyzed by CalcuSyn software (version 2;Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) and calculated by the Chou-Talalay method (25). CI values <1.0, =1, and >1.0 indicates synergistic interaction (more than additive), summation (additive), and antagonistic interaction (less than additive), respectively.
To determine the effect of TMZ in combination with MET on cell cycle progression, U87 and C6 gliospheres were cultured in NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, 2 µg/ml heparin and 20 ng/ml EGF+bFGF in the absence or presence of 0.4 mmol TMZ, 20 mmol MET or 0.4 mmol TMZ plus 20 mmol MET in 5% CO 2 incubator at 37˚C. After 48 h, the GSCs were dissociated by accutase (Sigma-Aldrich), fixed and permeabilized with 500 µl of 70% cold ethanol at -20˚C overnight. After washing in PBS, the cells were treated with 100 µg/ml of RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated at 37˚C for 30 min. Then the cells stained with 100 µg/ml of propidium iodide (PI, Sigma-Aldrich) at 4˚C for another 30 min in darkness. The percentage of cells at different cell cycle stages (G0/G1, G2/M and S phase) was determined on the basis of DNA content by flow cytometer using ModFit LT 3.3 software (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME, USA).
To determine the effect of TMZ or/and MET on GSCs apoptosis, U87 and C6 gliospheres were cultured in NBM with B27, N2, glutaMAX, 2 µg/ml heparin and 20 ng/ml EGF+bFGF in the absence or presence of 0.4 mmol TMZ, 20 mmol MET or 0.4 mmol TMZ plus 20 mmol MET in 5% CO 2 incubator at 37˚C. After 48 h, the GSCs were collected. Apoptotic and necrotic cell death was analyzed by double staining with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated annexin V and PI, in which annexin V bound to the early and late apoptotic cells with membrane-exposed phosphatidylserine, while PI labeled only the late apoptotic/necrotic cells with membrane damage. Staining was performed using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stained cells were analyzed with a BD FACSAria III flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The numbers of viable (annexin V-/PI-), apoptotic (annexin V+/PI-), and necrotic (annexin V+/PI+) cells were calculated with the FACSDiva software, version 6.2 (BD Biosciences).
Statistical analysis. The experiments were performed ≥3 times and data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons were assessed using the Student's t test. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software, version 19.0 (IBM SPSS< Armonk, NY, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
