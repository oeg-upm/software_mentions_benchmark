We received the fastq files of whole-exome sequencing results of tumor and matched normal sample data of 10 AML patients from the Korea Genome Organization in December 2012. There were no patient-related medical or characteristic data. We aligned the sequencing reads to the human reference genome (hg 19, GRCh37) from USCC by BWA 0.6.2 [12] (Figs. 1 and 2). To filter the known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used dbSNP bulid 137. We removed PCR duplicates and filtering low-quality SNPs bySamtools 0.1.18 [13], Picard 1.68 [14], and GATK 2.3.4 [15]. After the filtering process, the SAM file was converted to VCF file by VCF Tools 0.1.10 [16]. For detecting somatic mutation candidates, we obtained the difference in VCF files between tumor and normal samples. For annotation of these somatic mutation candidates, we used the ANNOVAR tool [17].
The most frequently mutated genes across all samples were USP9Y and MUC5B; these genes were mutated in 5 samples. These genes were also highly mutated in each sample; for USP9Y genes, it had 6 nonsynonymous mutations in sample 3. We have selected 45 highly mutated genes (1.5%) from 2981 mutated genes. We defined highly mutated genes as genes having 3 or more nonsynonymous mutations in each sample (Table 3). In a comparison of mutations with the COSMIC database [19], among 45 highly mutated genes, 21 genes matched to hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue malignancy terms, and 21 genes matched to other cancer types. In 3 genes, there was no matched term in COSMIC (Table 4).
