PCC assay employed in the present study is a modified technique described by Puig et al 10). The peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated for 2 h at 37 before and after irradiation for repair. Ficoll Histopaque density gradient method was used to separate lymphocytes from whole blood cells. Blood lymphocyte cultures were set up with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS and 0.2 ml of PHA (final concentration of 20 μg/ml) and incubated 37 for 48 h. One hour before harvesting i.e., after 47 h of incubation, cultures were centrifuged, culture volume was adjusted to 2.5 cm 3 , and Calyculin A (50 nM) or Okadaic acid (500 nM) was added to the culture. After about 1 h of incubation with the drug, cultures were harvested and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min to get a firm pellet with a clear supernatant. Supernatant was discarded and a pellet was disturbed and mixed thoroughly using a vertex. Pre-warmed (37 ) hypotonic solution (0.075 M KCl) was added to the pellet with constant vortex mixing. The pellets in the hypotonic solution were incubated at 37 for 6 min in a pre-warmed water bath and then centrifuged at 900 rpm for 8 min. The cells were fixed by cold fixative solution with 1: 3 mixtures of acetic acid and methanol after removing the supernatant and gentle agitation. To prepare the chromosome spread on slides, the cells were mixed thoroughly and dropped on a precleaned frozen slide from a certain height (~30 cm) followed by quick warm and air blow on the slide surface to get better spread of metaphase chromosomes. The slides were stained using giemsa stain for 10 to 12 min by dipping in staining solution and washing 3 to 4 times with a d.d.w. The slides were mounted with a cover slip using Deepex before scoring. PCC spreads were analyzed at 100X magnification with an Olympus BX 51 fluorescent microscope coupled to a Jenoptik C5 cooled CCD camera with ProgRes Capture Pro 2.8 software. 100rings per dose were scored. Two scoring criteria were used; one as suggested by Kanda et al. 4 ), which includes all spherical shaped PCC rings, and another suggested by Lamadrid et al. 18), which strictly limits ring evaluation to those which clearly defined open space. Extra fragments were recorded as those exceeding 46 pieces in G2/M PCC cells and 92 pieces in case of M/A PCC cells. For each ring, one fragment was not considered as extra fragment. For curve fitting, the minimum Chi-square method using Origin package was used. The distribution of PCC rings were analyzed by Papworth's u test 19 ). The detailed statistical analysis is given elsewhere 20 ). Briefly, the mean number of observed rings per cell (y) is given for each dose (D) along with relative variance (σ 2 /y) and the dispersion index (u). The u values are calculated using the relation;
