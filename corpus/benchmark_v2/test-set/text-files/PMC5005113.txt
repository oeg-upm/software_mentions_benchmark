To confirm whether the colonies represented homogenous species, we sequenced additional colonies from the agar plates randomly. For identification of the isolated culture, sequencing of the conserved genomic region was carried out using standard primer pair for the amplification (sequencing service was provided by Amnion Biosciences Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru, India). The amplicon used for the identification was 18S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence; internal transcribed spacer 1 and 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene, complete sequence; and internal transcribed spacer 2, partial sequence. The 488-base pair amplicon sequence was then searched for the similarity in US National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide collection database using the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN) using standard search parameters [32]. A phylogenetic tree was constructed later using first 10 hits from NCBI BLASTN search results and the query sequence using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 4.1 [33]. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbour-joining method. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analysed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in <50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete Deletion option). There were a total of 365 positions in the final dataset.
We used linear regression analysis to test the associations between selected independent variables (fungal status, and eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages) and forced midexpiratory flow (FEF25-75%) % predicted as the dependent variable. All linear regression models also took into account the covariates age, smoking status (current versus former or never) and duration of employment. In addition to testing models in which only one of the independent predictors of interest was included along with the adjusting covariates, we also tested models including both fungal status and either eosinophil or lymphocyte percentage in the same model. We did so in order to assess the potential mediation of any fungal association with lung function by the presence of sputum eosinophils or lymphocytes. Because sputum eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages were strongly correlated with one another (r=0.72, p<0.01) and both inversely correlated with the percent of macrophages (r= −0.63 and r= −0.55, respectively; both p<0.01), we did not include any of these in multivariate models. Eosinophil and lymphocyte percentages, however, were only weakly negatively correlated with the percent neutrophils (r= −0.22 ( p<0.05) and r= −0.24 ( p<0.10), respectively), allowing us to test whether inclusion of that variable had a substantive impact on the mediation by eosinophils of the association of fungal contamination with lung function. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 20 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Out of the targeted population of 79 males, we did not study those who did not provide consent (n=7), did not include those ineligible based on current antibiotic use (n=4) and excluded those without reproducible quality spirometry (n=8) or who were unable to expectorate adequate sputum samples (n=6). We ultimately analysed data for 54 (68%) wood process workers employed at the four targeted worksites. Of those studied, 19 (35%) produced a sputum sample in which fungus was detected, while 35 (65%) were sputum fungus negative. In the genomic fungal characterisation, hits generated using standard search parameters indicated the fungus belonged to the genus Candida. A phylogenetic tree constructed from the hits of NCBI BLASTN search results is presented in figure 1. The sequence has been submitted to NCBI database and can be accessed through the accession number GenBank KF483576.1. Fungus was not detected in saliva sample stains or cultures (figure 1).
