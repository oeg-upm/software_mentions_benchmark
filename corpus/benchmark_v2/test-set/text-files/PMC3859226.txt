V M represents the prepulse potential, V 0.5 is the potential at which half of channels are inactivated, and C is the fraction of non-inactivated channels, or asymptote. Recovery from inactivation was fitted to I (t) /I max = À A Â exp( Àt/) + C, with as time constant of recovery, A as respective amplitude of time constant and C as asymptote of recovery. Data were analysed by a combination of pClamp (Axon Instruments), Excel (Microsoft), SPSS (IBM) and ORIGIN (Microcal software). Data were presented as mean AE standard error of the mean (SEM). Student's t-tests were applied for statistical evaluation with the significance levels set to *P 5 0.05, **P 5 0.01, ***P 5 0.001.
