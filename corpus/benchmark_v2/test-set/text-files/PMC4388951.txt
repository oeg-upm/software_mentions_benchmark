Participants' nutritional status was assayed by a three-day food records. Subjects were advised to record all foods and beverages consumed throughout the day for two days of the week and one day of the weekend. According to the guideline of food portion size [21], amount of each dietary item they consumed was expressed in gram. Then these data were analyzed using Nutritionist IV software (First Databank, San Bruno, CA, USA) modified for Iranian foods and daily intakes of energy and some nutrients were obtained.
All analyses were performed based on Intention To Treat principle. The Statistical SPSS software program (version 11.5;SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all the statistical analyses. The data were checked for normality using KolmogorovSmirnov test. Presentation of data was as mean (standard deviation), median (percentile 25, percentile 75) and frequency (percentage). Baseline indices were compared in vitamin K group versus placebo group to examine if the randomization was appropriate. Independent sample-t test, Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher exact test were used to compare baseline values between two groups. In order to determination the effects of treatment at the end of intervention, relevant confounders .i.e; duration of RA, energy intake, weight, prothrombin time and baseline values were adjusted (ANCOVA test).
