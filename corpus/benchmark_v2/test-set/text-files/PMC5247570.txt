Immunoblotting analysis was evaluated following the previous method [2]. PVDF membranes including blotted proteins were visualized by WEST One TM western blot detection system (iNtRON Biotechnology, Inc, Gyeonggi-do, Korea). The level of target proteins was compared to that of a loading control (β-actin or non-phosphorylated proteins), and the results were expressed as a ratio of density of each protein identified by a protein standard size marker (BIOFACT, Daejeon, Korea). The relative density of the protein expression was quantitated by Matrox Inspector software (version 2.1 for Windows;Matrox Electronic Systems Ltd., Dorval, Quebec, Canada).
The experimental results were listed as means ± SD for in vitro studies or SEM for in vivo studies. One-way ANOVA was used for multiple comparisons (GraphPad Prism version 5.03 for Windows, San Diego, CA, USA). If there was a significant variation between treated groups, the Dunnett's or Turkey's tests were applied. Differences at the *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 levels were considered statistically significant.
