High-definition (HD)-OCT (Cirrus high-definition 5000 OCT) with an axial resolution of 5 mm was performed on all 70 eyes with RP and 65 eyes of the normal controls. Cross-section images of 6 mm horizontal and vertical scans through the central fovea were obtained. A macular cube 512 Ã‚ 128 scan was obtained by Cirrus HD-OCT to obtain the central fovea thicknesses (CFT) and GCIPLT data. The macula thickness and the outer rings, bounded by 3 and 6 mm concentric circles, were constructed using the automated software algorithm. Central subfield thickness was defined as the average thickness in the central 1 mm subfield centered on the fovea. Average macular thickness, foveal thickness, outer macular (superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal) thicknesses, and macular volume were obtained for each eye. The GCA algorithm was incorporated into the newer Cirrus OCT software version 6.5 with the annulus of inner vertical and horizontal diameters of 1 and 1.2 mm, respectively, and outer vertical and horizontal diameters of 4 and 4.8 mm, respectively. As reported, [27] the outer ring size includes the area where the GCL is thickest in a healthy eye. The GCA algorithm identifies the outer boundaries of RNFL and IPL, between which is the GCIPL layer. GCIPLT will be analyzed according to 8 parameters-average, minimum, and 6 sectors (superonasal, superior, superotemporal, inferotemporal, inferior, and inferonasal)-by the GCA algorithm embedded in Cirrus OCT. Grayscale images were used for a more precise identification and measurement of the EZ. Length was measured in the horizontal and vertical scans, and an average value was obtained. Outer retinal thickness (ORT) was defined as the region from the outer plexiform layer to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer/ Bruch complex, consisting of the outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, extend limiting membrane (ELM), myoid zone, EZ, interdigitation zone, and RPE/Bruch complex. ORT was measured 1 mm from the fovea in the horizontal and vertical scans, and an average value was obtained.
Statistical analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (version 20.0; SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL). Photographs were made using SPSS 20.0 and Graph Pad Prism 5 software (Graph Pad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Differences between the RP patients and the normal controls were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Associations between the various OCT parameters and BCVA were examined using Spearman rank correlation. All factors affecting visual acuity were analyzed further by multiple linear regressions. Criterion significance was assessed at the P < 0.05 level.
