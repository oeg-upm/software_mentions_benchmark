Statistical analysis was performed using the program SPSS, version 14. The sample's characteristics were described with descriptive measures such as mean, standard deviation, percentages and range. Student's t-test and, when appropriate, Mann-Whitney test were used for quantitative variables, and Spearman and Pearson's correlations for ordinal variables. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test (whenever chi-square assumptions were not met) were calculated for nominal variables. To assess the effect of past variables on current psychological distress and its detection by physicians and nurses, multiple logistic regression was carried out.
