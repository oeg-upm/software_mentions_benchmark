The total volume of drained blood and the decrease in hemoglobin at 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 5 days postoperatively were recorded. Blood transfusions were recorded as the number of units of packed erythrocytes. All patients were discharged from the hospital after two weeks of surgery. All quantitative data were expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation. Statistical significance of differences in the mean values of continuous variables such as age, preoperative hemoglobin, total volume of drained blood, and postoperative decrease in hemoglobin level were determined using Student t-test. Chi-square test was used for categorical data including the need for blood transfusion. SPSS ver.14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All aspects of the statistical analysis were reviewed by a statistician.
