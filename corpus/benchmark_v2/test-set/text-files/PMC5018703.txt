For the purpose of this report, hepatitis B surveillance data between January 2004 and December 2013 were analyzed. Prevalence trends refer to rates over time of diagnosed seropositive cases of hepatitis B. The carriage rate for a certain yea, or demographic group (gender, age group) was calculated by dividing the number of reported seropositive cases for hepatitis B for that year, or demographic group by the corresponding estimated population for that year, or demographic group, then multiplied to give the rate per 100,000. All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to calculate the odds ratios (OR) and the respective 95% confidence interval (CI) for the decline in hepatitis B prevalence between 2004 and 2013. We used the 2004 prevalence for reference to calculate the OR and p-values compared with this year. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis. We used 5% (p<0.05) as a level of significance.
