SVM classifier Z-scored values of each physiological parameter were used for linear SVM classification. SVM is a supervised machine learning method for data classification that can be trained to find the best hyperplane that separates all data points in two userdefined classes and can subsequently be exploited to blindpredict the class to which a new observation belongs (37-39). We defined two classes: mutated (heterozygous and null) and wild-type (males and females) mice. By using the Matlab function svmtrain, we trained the SVM with a subset of data consisting of 50% of the dataset and we than used the remaining 50% for testing, using the svmclassify function. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and D-prime (d 0 ) were then computed for the categorical classification in order to evaluate its performance. This procedure was repeated 200 times, each one with a randomly divided training and testing subsets. Values for accuracy, sensitivity (or true positive rate), specificity (or true negative rate) and d 0 were averaged across iterations. Accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were defined as (TP Ã¾ TN)/total, TP/P and TN/N, respectively, where TP: True positive, TN: True Negative, P: total positives, N: total negatives. D-prime, which measures the distance between the signal and the noise means in standard deviation units (40), was calculated using matlab function dprime_simple (https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileex change/47711-dprime-simple-m; date last accessed April 1, 2017).
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). All values were presented as mean 6 SEM unless otherwise stated. Differences between groups were tested for significance using two-way ANOVA, unless otherwise indicated. Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons post hoc tests were performed, where appropriate, to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. In the figures, n.s., not significative, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.
