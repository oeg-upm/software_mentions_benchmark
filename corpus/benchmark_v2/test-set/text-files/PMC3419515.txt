Mapping of sequencing reads and quantitative PCR. Sequencing reads were mapped using the software program MAQ (40) onto the published E. coli (NC_000913.2) and Salmonella Typhimurium (CP001363.1) genomes, allowing up to two mismatches per read. The number of reads mapped to each nucleotide position on each strand was obtained by parsing the MAQ pileup file using a custom Perl script, as previously described (18). The expression levels of genes were estimated by identifying the maximum number of reads that mapped to the sense and antisense strands of annotated open reading frames (ORFs). Background expression levels were calculated for 53 genes (see Table S6 in the supplemental material) that were not expressed in a previous microarray-based study in exponential-phase E. coli in LB (41). Microarray data were downloaded from the Oklahoma University E. coli Gene Expression Database (http: //genexpdb.ou.edu/main/). Read depths for these genes ranged from 0 to 19. Based on these, we used a cutoff of 20 reads to designate an asRNA as expressed.
Analysis of nucleotide sequence divergence and polymorphism. Patterns of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism were analyzed to infer whether promoter regions regulating asRNA expression are subject to functional constraint. To calculate levels of nucleotide sequence divergence, protein-coding gene sequences containing identified antisense TSSs were extracted from the genome sequence of either E. coli (NC_000913.2) or Salmonella (CP001363.1) and aligned with orthologous sequences from the other species. Codon-based nucleotide alignments were generated by aligning translated amino acid sequences using the software program MUSCLE v3.7 and then converting them back to nucleotide sequences (46). Divergence values were calculated using third codon positions only, which are largely synonymous and thus less susceptible to selection acting on the sense-strand-encoded amino acid sequence. Alignment gaps were excluded from divergence estimates.
To provide a basis of comparison for the patterns of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism observed in antisense promoter regions, we identified TSSs for a set of highly expressed protein-coding mRNAs (maximum read depth of at least 200) in E. coli and Salmonella (67 and 55 loci, respectively). For this set of control loci, we extracted gene sequences along with associated 5= regions extending 200 bp upstream of the identified TSS from the same sets of genomes described above. Nucleotide alignments were performed in MUSCLE, and sequence divergence and polymorphism values were calculated as described above, except that there was no filtering based on codon position for upstream noncoding sequences. Genes with unalignable upstream regions were excluded from the analysis.
For both interspecific and intraspecific comparisons, putative orthologs were identified as pairs of genes that returned top hits in reciprocal searches between a pair of genomes with NCBI tBLASTn v2.2.24 (48). All analyses were conducted with custom Perl scripts utilizing BioPerl modules (49).
