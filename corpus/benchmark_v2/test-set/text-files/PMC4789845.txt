Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Briefly, the cell lines were plated in 96-well plates (3,000 per well), and allowed to grow for 24, 48, and 72 hours, then assessed by a colorimetric assay using MTT solution (10 mg/mL) at 570 nm. Cell invasion ability assay was performed using transwell invasion chambers coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Cells were suspended in FBS-free medium and added to the upper chamber, while the medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 24 hours of incubation, the cells remaining on the upper membrane were removed with cotton wool, whereas the cells that had invaded through the membrane were stained with methanol and 0.1% crystal violet, imaged, and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell migration ability was assessed by performing wound healing assays. Cells were cultured to 100% confluence, and wounds were generated using pipette tips. The cells were then cultured for 24 or 48 hours and the wound closure was assessed by Scion Image Software (Scion Image
          Beta 4.03; Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, USA).
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Experimental data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was analyzed using Student's t-test. The correlation between miR-381 and Twist1 expression was analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying inhibitory effects of miR-381 on proliferation, invasion, and migration of CRC cells, we predicted potential targets of miR-381. Using TargetScan and miRanda tools online, we screened several invasion-and migration-related genes by RTq-PCR, of which Twist1 expression was significantly repressed in miR-381 expressing HT29 and SW480 cells. In addition, Twist1 is an important inducer of EMT, which is involved in cell invasion and migration ability, 24,25 and hence we focused on Twist1 in the study. To validate if miR-381 directly targets Twist1 3′UTR (Figure 3A), luciferase reporter assays were performed in HT29 and SW480 cells, which revealed that miR-381 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activity of wild-type Twist1 3′UTR reporter, but had no effect on the Twist1 3′UTR reporter with mutant miR-381 binding seed sites (Figure 3B). RTq-PCR and Western blot also validated that miR-381 mimics reduced Twist1 expression, and miR-381 inhibitor mimics increased Twist1 expression in HT29 and SW480 cells (Figure 3C and D). Moreover, RTq-PCR analysis revealed that Twist1 expression was significantly increased in CRC tumors compared with paired normal mucosal tissue (Figure 3E) and inversely correlated with the expression levels of miR-381 in CRC tissues used in the study (Figure 3F). Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-381 directly inhibits Twist1 expression in CRC cells.
