We employed the Dreiding 53 force field with ab initio point charges fit to the electrostatic potential, and optimized the unit cell using a combination of steepest descent, Newton-Raphson and quasi-Newton methods 19. The long-range periodic electrostatic interactions were evaluated by Ewald sums. The results presented here are based on a lattice energy minimization of motionless molecules (that is, finite temperature effects are totally neglected). To validate this approach, we attempted to reproduce the experimental crystal structure of 1. For 1, the initial guess for the optimization was the experimentally determined unit cell. The effect of charges calculated by PBE/DNP 34 and B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) levels of theory on the unit cell parameters of 1 are shown in Supplementary Table S1, indicated by (DNP) and (G), respectively. Both yield comparable structure parameters to the experimentally determined unit cell, although B3LYP/6-311 + G(d,p) charges have slightly better agreement with the experimental unit cell parameters and density. Consequently, the latter was used for the computations on 2 and 7. All crystal prediction calculations were carried out with the Materials Studio Modules, Forcite and DMol 34.
