RNA extraction and quantitative (q)PCR. Total RNA was extracted from gastric cancer cells using TRIzol ® reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using an RT-PCR kit. qPCR was performed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) using the THUN-DERBIRD ® SYBR ® qPCR Mix. The qPCR consisted of 35 cycles of 94˚C for 30 sec, 56˚C for 30 sec and 72˚C for 30 sec. ER-α36 and β-actin primers were designed using Primer Premier 5.0 software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and had the following sequences: ER-α36 forward, 5'-ACA AGT GGT TTC CTC GTG TCTAA-3' and reverse, 5'-GGG TGT TGA GTG TTG GTTGC-3'; and β-actin forward, 5'-ATG ATG ATA TCG CCG CGCTC-3'; and reverse, 5'-GTA CAT GGC TGG GGT GTTGA-3' . β-actin was used as an internal invariant endogenous control for qPCR. Expression levels were determined using the relative 2(-∆∆C(T)) method. All experiments were performed at least three times to ensure the reproducibility of the results.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 12.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate samples, and differences were compared using the Student's t-test or one-way analysis of variance. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. All experiments were performed at least three times to ensure the reproducibility of the results.
