All staining experiments were performed with the appropriate positive and negative controls. A series of slides containing tissues with a previously established positive reaction with the primary antibodies were used as the positive control. To account for nonspecific staining, sections incubated without the primary antibody were used as the negative control. Sections were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus BX51; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Colocalization of staining was visualized using image analysis software (Image Pro Plus 5.0; Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) by applying the Boolean operator 'AND'. This operator combined individual unmixed images into a novel image that consisted solely of colocalized (double-stained) pixels, thus representing only double-stained cells (yellow). The relative intensities of NF, S-100, Syn, N-Syn within individual cells were determined by Image Pro Plus software by measuring the integral optical densities (IOD) of 80-100 cells that were sampled from each subject randomly (16) Data analysis. All slides were reviewed blindly by two pathologists. Immunopositive cells were counted on 10 well-stained, randomly selected, microscopic fields at x40 magnification (Olympus BX51) for each region of interest.
Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation. The Kruskal-Wallis test by ranks followed by the Mann-Whitney test was used to rank the Syn-immunoreactivity data. One-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test was used for the comparisons of NF-positive neurons. Pearson correlations/Spearman's rank order correlation was used to evaluate the correlations between the neuronal counts and Syn-immunoreactivity cell numbers. Data were analyzed with SPSS 20.0 software (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
