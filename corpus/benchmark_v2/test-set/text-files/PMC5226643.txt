the wash retrieved from the U-Pb chemistry (see the Supplementary Materials for analytical details). This approach allows us to unambiguously link Hf isotope compositions to the U-Pb ages (28). The Lu/Hf of each zircon was measured by ICPMS on an aliquot of the same solution to correct for in situ radiogenic growth of 176 Hf since zircon crystallization. The effects of possible neutron capture on the Apollo 14 zircon Hf isotopic ratios were assessed by examining the deviation of their 178 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios from normal (terrestrial and chondritic) values (24, 29). Most of our zircons [as well as the zircons analyzed by Taylor et al. (20)] have been affected to some degree by cosmic ray exposure with offsets up to 2.14 e 178 Hf from the terrestrial value (Fig. 2). We corrected for these effects using the data and procedure of Sprung et al.Hf(t) values, shown as a function of crystallization age in Fig. 3, are the lowest measured in lunar materials, with the least radiogenic samples in the Apollo 14 population having initial 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios within 1 to 2 e units (0.01 to 0.02%) of the solar system initial value (Supplementary Materials) (16). These data indicate the formation of the zircons in a highly enriched magma, termed urK-REEP (30), which agrees with the previous conclusions of Taylor et al. (20). However, the precision of the data presented here and the corrections for cosmic ray exposure (23) Hf source = 0, which corresponds to the maximum elemental fractionation possible for the reservoir that the zircons crystallized from. Although this represents extreme Lu/Hf fractionation, it is reasonably consistent with expectations for fractional crystallization of an LMO and production of zircon in the last residual melt (urKREEP). A pMELTS simulation (31) Hf during KREEP crystallization shows that it quickly evolves to <0.01 at less than 50% melt remaining (Supplementary Materials). Any choice of a higher Lu/Hf ratio for the source necessarily yields older model separation ages; our results therefore provide minimum ages for differentiation of the LMO from CHUR and a minimum age for the formation of the Moon. Our model age results are presented in Fig. 4, together with those from Taylor et al. (20) corrected for neutron capture effects. Because some of the Apollo 14 zircons with initial e 176 Hf(t) values closer to chondritic could be derived from KREEP-rich magmas that had undergone partial assimilation of crustal rocks, we take the oldest model ages as the minimum age for LMO solidification. To determine this minimum age, we averaged the four oldest zircon Lu/Hf model ages, resulting in 4.51 Â± 0.01 Gy (1s).This study Taylor et al. (20 ) Taylor et al. (20 ), NC-corrected CHUR
All data reduction, error propagation, and U-Pb data plotting were done using the U-Pb_Redux software package (48). All reported uncertainties were 2s and included only internal sources of uncertainty (counting statistics, uncertainties in correcting for mass discrimination, and the uncertainty in common Pb composition). Forty procedural blanks spiked with the same tracers and run within a period of 3 years (21 of which in the course of this study) showed an amount of common Pb (Pbc = 0.2 to 13.9 pg; average, 3.6 pg) that agreed well with that found in zircon analyses; therefore, all common Pb was assumed to be derived from procedural blanks. A and B). U-Pb results show that L1 and some of L2 analyses had low radiogenic-tocommon Pb ratios and were discordant (table S1B), whereas most of the residues and L2 have high radiogenic-to-common Pb ratios and are concordant (table S1A). This illustrates that the chemical abrasion technique efficiently removed portion of grains that were affected by Pb loss. Hf measurements were performed only on the most concordant grains (tables S1A and S3), which are plotted on Fig. 1 in a traditional concordia plot.
