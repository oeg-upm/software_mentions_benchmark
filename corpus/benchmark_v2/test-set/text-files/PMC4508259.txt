The economic benefit of a U-healthcare system must become clear if the system is to be widely accepted. In other words, it must be shown that the medical and social cost reductions achieved are greater than the expenses associated with establishment, application, and maintenance of the system. Such costs include commercialization, provision of new devices, the labor of medical teams, systems maintenance, and server management. Any measure enhancing patient care and satisfaction, while minimizing personal expense, must be cost-effective [42]. Artificial intelligence systems minimizing the medical manpower necessary for effective patient management are required. Such software would maximally reduce social and medical expenses. In fact, such a program (System for Automatic Verification, or SAVE) was recently applied inclinical research, and reduced physician labor by 50%, thus affording efficiency, stability, and economic benefit. SAVE will contribute to commercialization of U-healthcare systems by reducing labor costs [43].
