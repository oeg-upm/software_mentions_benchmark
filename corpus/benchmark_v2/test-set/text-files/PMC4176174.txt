For cryoEM, aliquots of IC and EC were applied onto glow-discharged, holey carbon grids (carbon-coated Quantifoil R 1.2/ R1.3 300 mesh grids) containing an additional continuous thin layer of carbon, and plunged into liquid ethane. Images were acquired under minimal dose conditions with a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. The images were taken at magnification of ∼110 000 using a 16 megapixel (Mpx) FEI Eagle CCD camera with a step size of 15 m, thus the original pixel size of the acquired images was 1.37Å. Cryo-EM micrographs were downsampled by a factor of 2 or 3 (EC and IC, respectively). The contrast transfer function of the each acquired image was estimated using CTFFIND 3 program (16) and corrected at the micrograph level. Individual particles were selected manually and extracted using XMIPP software (17) (Supplementary Figure S (19)) were carried out with normalized particles. Homogeneous populations were obtained and averaged for a final two-dimensional (2D) characterization.
Several starting reference models and initial 3D reconstruction steps based on iterative angular refinement were performed using the EMAN software package (20). In general the initial volumes were created upon the class averages generated in the previous step, using a common lines approach or by using artificial noisy models and Gaussian blobs with the rough dimensions of the protein complexes. In the case of the streptavidin labeled complexes and those complexes analyzed by cryo-EM, the previously obtained EM maps of non-labeled or negatively-stained complexes were filtered to 70Å, and used as the initial models. The different strategies converged to similar solutions, and one of the models was selected to complete the refinement (Supplementary Figure S2C). However, in the case of heterogeneity (EC cryo-EM; streptavidin-biotin labeled ICs) the most stable model was subjected to maximum likelihood 3D classification (ML3D) (18) to address this problem. The separated particles were processed using EMAN and the whole 3D reconstruction cycle was repeated de novo. The resolution of the reconstructions was determined by the FSC 0.5 criterion (Supplementary Figure S3), and these values were used to low-pass filter the final volumes. The visualization of density maps and atomic structures was performed using UCSF Chimera (21). The dockings were firstly performed manually and then rendered by Chimera, using a real time correlation criterion between the reference model (final model) and the surface created from the atomic structure/model.
