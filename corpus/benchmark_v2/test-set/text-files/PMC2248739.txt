After electrophoresis for 3 h at 900 V and 12 mA, gels were dried, exposed to a PhosphorScreen overnight and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). ImageQuant software was used to measure cleavage intensities at each residue position. Positions 78 and 80 were used as standards to normalize cleavage intensities at all other positions because they were consistently strongly cleaved in independent reactions. To calculate fold differences in cleavage intensities between mutant and wild-type RNA, sxy-1 or sxy-7 values were divided by wild-type values at each position. At positions where mutant RNAs were more weakly cut than wildtype, wild-type values were instead divided by mutant and then expressed as a negative value.
