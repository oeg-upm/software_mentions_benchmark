Overcharging OverchargingThe term undertreatment refers to providing q 0 when the consumer needs q 1 ; overtreatment refers to providing q 1 when the consumer needs q 0 ; and overcharging refers to charging p 1 when q 0 has been provided. 6 Dulleck et al. (2011) have a total of 16 experimental treatments (on the role of liability, verifiability, competition and reputation) of which we discuss only two here (and add two new ones). The main difference in experimental design between the new treatments and those in Dulleck et al. (2011) is our reliance on (carefully designed) exogenously given prices for different qualities of the good rather than letting sellers endogenously decide on prices. To emphasise this difference, we refer to the treatments B/N and B/V in Dulleck et al. (2011) as treatments N-Endo and V-Endo here, while the new treatments have names ending in -Exo. of customers and sellers within each matching group after each period. All experimental sessions were run computerised using zTree (Fischbacher, 2007) and recruiting was done via ORSEE (Greiner, 2004). A total of 184 subjects participated in treatments N-Endo and V-Endo.
