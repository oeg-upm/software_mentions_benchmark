All participants were instructed not to exercise excessively and to refrain from caffeinated beverages, alcoholic beverages, and smoking for 3 hours before the psychophysiological measurements were collected. A lead II electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected for 5 minutes at baseline using the ProComp Infiniti TM system (Thought Technology Ltd., Montreal, Canada), which was installed on a laptop. A sampling rate of 2,048/second was set in order to acquire real-time interbeat intervals. The physiological signals were collected between 9:00 to 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. to minimize any effects of biological circadian variations. The CardiacPro Infiniti HRV analysis module (Thought Technology Ltd.) with fast Fourier transformation was used to transform the interbeat intervals into the various frequency domains of the HRV indices, namely LF power (0.04-0.15 Hz), HF power (0.15-0.4 Hz), and the LF/HF ratio. The time domain of the HRV index of the SDNN was also obtained.
The demographic data and information related to heroin use, including the history of substance use, the age of onset of heroin use, and the number of times the participants had tried previously to quit heroin use, were collected among heroin users. The BDI-II total score and cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression were obtained at pre-intervention and post-intervention from all participants. The HRV-BF was carried out using ProComp Infiniti TM software together with ECG and respiration sensors, which were used to acquire real-time feedback regarding respiration rate, breathing patterns, RSA amplitude, and HRV indices. The HRV indices as the outcome variables were obtained at pre-intervention and at postintervention.
The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with MannWhitney U post-hoc comparisons were used to examine the group differences in age, total score, and cognitive/somatic symptoms of depression, and HRV indices across the three groups. Spearman's rank correlations were used to examine the association between depression total scores and HRV indices. The statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics ver. 18.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA).
Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine the effects of HRV-BF on the depression total score, and cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression that were measured by BDI-II; these were compared pre-intervention and post-intervention. The effects of HRV-BF were also examined by comparing the HRV indices and respiration rates during the various experimental conditions, pre-and post-intervention. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics ver. 18.0.
