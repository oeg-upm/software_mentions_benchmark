Body weights, hematology, and clinical chemistry test results were tested using SAS (version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., U.S.A). The Bartlett test was performed for homoscedasticity (significance level: 0.05). In the case of homoscedasticity, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to yield significance (significance level: 0.05), and multiple testing of Dunnett's t-test was carried out (significance level: 0.05 on both sides and 0.01). For heteroscedasticity, significance (significance level: 0.05) was checked by using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple testing with the Steel test was carried out (significance level: 0.05 on both sides and 0.01).
