Data such as these suggest that costs associated with patentssearching prior art, building patent portfolios, and defending against the threat of patent litigation-have grown very substantially, and may now be having a significantly negative impact on the pace of innovation in the industry. To cite just two authoritative observers, Donald Knuth, author of The Art of Computer Programming and inventor of TeX, has stated that "I don't think I would have been able to create  TeX if the present [patent] climate had existed in the 1970s," while erstwhile entrepreneur Bill Gates has opined that "If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today."
Turning to the impact of patent thickets on financing, the first three columns of Table III present results from Poisson regressions on the number of new ventures receiving their first round of financing from external investors. As before, standard errors are clustered by market, and all regressions have market and year fixed effects. The dependent variable is the number of firms in market j that have not previously received external financing and which obtain such investment for the first time in year t. (The following section describes in greater detail how this indicator is constructed, and performs a firm-level analysis of the probability that a firm receives initial investment by a given year. Here we present a preview of these findings by examining the broad market-level association between in initial financing episodes and patenting in the market.) The regressions are run on a balanced panel of observations on our 27 markets between 1994 and 2002, for a total of 243 observations. The number of firms in a market receiving investment for the first time in year t will depend on the number of firms "at risk" (i.e., the number of early-stage firms that have not previously received investment). We therefore include in the regression a count of the total number of new ventures identified as being present in the previous sample year. Additional controls include the stage of development of firms in the market (the average age of the firms), and the same variables as in the entry regressions to control for demand and market structure, which affect the anticipated profitability of entrants. In column (1) the coefficient on the number of patents in force is large and negative, implying that software ventures that enter markets with larger patent thickets see are less likely to receive funding from outside investors. In this regression the estimated coefficient is negative and significant at the 10% level. 37 36. These effects were obtained by calculating the pre-and post-regime change difference in the partial derivative with respect to the log of patents in the market, using Stata's predictnl command. This command computes standard errors via the delta method. See Ai and Norton (2003) for more on interaction effects in nonlinear models.
These results show the importance of controlling for market characteristics, and in the hazard models, our explanatory variables include year and product market fixed effects and the modal citation lag for patents in the market. Other market-level controls relating to profitability in the firm's target market include the number of 40. These graphs were created using Stata's sts command, which estimates separate Cox regressions for each percentile group. Adjusting for the number of incumbents means that the number of incumbents and the number of incumbents squared were included as covariates in the Cox regression. incumbents in the market and the number of incumbents squared, and the growth of sales in the market. 41 Variables relating to the patent landscape include the log of the patent stock in the market and the Herfindahl over assignees of citations made by patents in the market. 42 Firm-level explanatory variables include the aforementioned dummies for firm size range, implicitly the age of the firm (because the "duration" variable is years since the birth of the firm), and the number of each firm's patents granted and pending. 43 Table IV gives results from these regressions, reported as hazard ratios. Estimates larger than one indicating a positive effect on the hazard of receiving funding, and estimates less than one indicating a negative effect. In general the hazard of funding is nonlinearly related to the number of competitors in the market, with an initial increasepresumably reflecting an increase in expected profits due to a reduction in the market power of incumbents or a reduction of barriers to entry created by network effects-then falling as the number of incumbents increases, which could reflect the fact that large numbers of incumbents indicate more mature, more crowded, and less attractive markets. The dummies for the range of firm size (not reported, but available upon request) display a concave relationship between firm size and the hazard of initial funding. The standard errors in these regressions are somewhat sensitive to the selection of control variables, but adding or dropping control variables has little effect on the estimated coefficients on the patent variables.
