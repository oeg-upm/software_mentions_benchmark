Image acquisition and quantification. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a microscope (Observer.D1; Carl Zeiss) using an LD A-Plan 10×/0.25 NA Ph1 M27 objective lens with the DAPI, GFP, or Texas red fluorochromes. Cells were imaged in PBS at room temperature, and images were acquired using the microscopy camera Axiom 503 mono(D) with the acquisition software AxioVision Rel 4.7 (Carl Zeiss). For quantification analyses, 30 10× fields per well were acquired and quantified using a high-content screening system (ArrayScan VTI; Cellomics Technology). Cells labeled by antibody staining and total cell number (based on DAPI nuclei staining) were quantified to obtain percentages of target cell types.
Total RNA was extracted from frozen cell pellets using Ambion Pure Link RNA Mini kit (Life Technologies). Eight cDNA reactions were set up from 1 µg of total RNA per sample using a High-Capacity cDNA RT kit (Life Technologies). qPCR was performed on 384-well TaqMan hPSC Scorecard plates using Viia7 RUO software and a ViiA7 instrument (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to the mean expression level of five control genes that are highly invariant in expression during directed differentiation. Differentiation potential was calculated (Bock et al., 2011) for four gene classes (EC, ectoderm; ME, mesoderm; EN, endoderm; PP, pluripotent).
