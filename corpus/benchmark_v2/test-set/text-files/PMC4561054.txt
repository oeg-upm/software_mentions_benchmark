The primary endpoint was comparison of steady-state pharmacokinetics of simeprevir between subjects with severe renal impairment and matched subjects with normal renal function. The secondary endpoint was short-term safety and tolerability. No formal sample size determination was performed; a sample size of eight subjects per group was considered sufficient for pharmacokinetic assessment. Subjects who received at least one dose of the study medication were included in the analysis (intentionto-treat population). Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted with WinNonlin Professional TM version 4.1 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD]) were calculated for total and unbound plasma concentrations at each time point. For the full pharmacokinetic profile, the minimum plasma concentration (C min ), maximum plasma concentration (C max ), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at 24 h (AUC 24 ) on the logarithmic scale were the primary pharmacokinetic parameters of interest. A linear mixed-effects model (controlling for renal function) was used to estimate the least-squares (LS) means for each of the parameters. A 90 % confidence interval (CI) was created around the difference between the LS means in the renal impairment and control groups. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for the comparison of the time to maximal plasma concentration (T max ) between groups. No formal hypothesis testing was performed.
