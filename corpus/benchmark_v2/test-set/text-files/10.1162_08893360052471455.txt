As in most exercises of this type, the equity-premium puzzle remains a serious problem. For income and dividend processes and participation rates based on historical data, the model predicts an unrealistically small equity premium. We have increased the assumed volatility of aggregate income to increase the predicted premium, but want to emphasize that this may not be a neutral adjustment with respect to the other quantities of interest.10 4.2.1 Income and Preferences Let y(t) -log[Ya(t)/Ya(t -1)] be the growth rate of aggregate nonmarketed income at time t. Then the aggregate state of the economy is given by z(t) = [y(t) d(t)]', which is assumed to be generated by a Markov chain. To calibrate a process for z(t) we assume that a period corresponds to 25 years. The first period roughly corresponds to the working years between age 40 and retirement, and the second period is the time in retirement. Over the period 1889 to 1985, the average annual (log) growth rate in real aggregate consumption was 1.7% with a standard deviation of 3.5%. So that the model will produce a nonnegligible equity premium, we assume that the standard deviation of the aggregate growth rate in the model is 1.5 times the historical standard deviation of aggregate 9. The Matlab code is available upon request. 10. Recently Campbell and Cochrane (1998) suggested that time-varying habit provides a higher estimate of the equity premium in a model based on aggregate consumption. However, Cochrane (1997) claims that this preference specification cannot account for the recent run-up in stock prices.consumption. For the same reason, we assume that annual income growth is independently and identically distributed over time, although in fact it is slightly negatively autocorrelated. This implies a 25-year average (log) growth rate of 42.5% with a standard deviation of 17.5%. This distribution is discretized by assuming that y takes on the values 0.16 and 0.69 with equal conditional probability. The capital share in total income averages approximately 30%. Consistent with the aggregate statistics reported in Heaton and Lucas (1998), we assume that only half of this capital income is actually tradable. The nontradable portion, generated by private business holdings, is accounted for in nonmarketed income. Since dividends in the model are scaled relative to nonmarketed income, this means that we require d(t) to average 18%. In most of the calculations d(t) is fixed at 18%. In other experiments described below, we assume a more volatile dividend process to proxy for a lack of diversification.11
