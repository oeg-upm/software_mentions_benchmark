The variables investigated included age, sex, type of intervention, clinical stage, parameters of uroflowmetry, and urinary symptomatology. Comparative analysis was conducted by using the Pearson χ 2 statistic or Fisher exact test for categorical data, and paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test for investigation of sequential continuous variables. All data were expressed as mean ±standard deviation, and SPSS ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software was used for statistical processing. Differences were considered to be significant when P<0.05.
