The video clip was downloaded to a computer and processed with a video-editing software (Sony Vegas Pro 10.0; Sony Creative Software Inc., Middleton, WI, USA). Each frame was reviewed and analyzed. Two frames including the subject's lip at rest position and a maximum commissure-to-commissure dynamic smile were captured. These frames were converted into a JPEG file and renamed in Windows XP Professional (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) with the subjects' numbers. Each file was opened in Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and the image size of each file was adjusted by using the millimeter ruler as a reference.
