All EMSA autoradiographs were scanned and the integrated band intensities were quantified using the Intelligent Quantifier software (Bio Image). For each lane, the background intensity was also measured and subtracted from the band intensities. Only the integrated intensities (I.I.) from the unbound DNA bands were considered for further analysis because of the 'smearing' effect. All I.I. values where divided by the average of two I.I. measurements of free DNA (without addition of Ss-LrpB). This corresponds to the fraction of unbound DNA. The fraction of bound DNA in each lane was then calculated to be: fraction bound DNA ¼ 1 À fraction unbound DNA. These quantitated data were plotted versus Ss-LrpB concentration (binding profile) and fitted using the Hill equation (Origin, non-linear least squares method):
