All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) statistical software for Windows. All quantitative data were presented as mean Â± standard deviation. The one-way analysis of variance test with post hoc Bonferroni correction was performed to compare the parameters IC, nIC, IC ratio, and nIC ratio between GC and GI, GC and NGM, and GI and NGM both in AP and PVP, with P < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of IC, nIC, IC ratio, and nIC ratio and to establish the optimal threshold values to discriminating GC from NGM and GI. Area under curve (AUC) for the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff value were calculated. The null hypothesis tested was that the AUC was 0.5, and the alternative was that the AUC was greater than 0.5.
