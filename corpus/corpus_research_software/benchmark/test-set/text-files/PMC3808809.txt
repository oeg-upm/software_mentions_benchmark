The experiments were carried out in a multi-chamber with ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system housing a SPECS variable temperature STM with a base pressure of less than 2 3 10 210 mbar. Si (111)-(7 3 7) surfaces were cleaned by degassing samples at , 600uC for 12 h and then flash annealing at , 1200uC with direct current sample heating for 15-30 s under UHV conditions. After several hours of degassing, fullerene (Aldrich, purity 99%) was evaporated from a Knudsen cell at 623 K onto the Si surfaces at room temperature. STM-images were acquired at room temperature with a chemically etched W tip. Positive voltage indicates that the samples were biased positively with respect to the tip. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by plane-wave-based Vienna Ab-initio simulations package [VASP] 32.
