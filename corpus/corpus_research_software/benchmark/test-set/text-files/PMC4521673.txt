An iterative analysis, drawing primarily on constant comparative methodology, was used. This involved moving back and forth between interview transcripts to support the evolution of the process by identifying emerging themes and defining the relationships between them. 16-19 The validity and the accuracy/reliability of the early codes were established by each member of the experienced qualitative team (ALK, MSM, KMF, and KBF) analyzing the initial four transcripts, coming to consensus, thus defining the initial codebook. Emergent codes were added throughout the analysis. The remaining interviews were divided among the team and coded using ATLAS.ti (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development GmbH). The consistency of coding/interpretation was checked at biweekly meetings where discrepancies were addressed through consensus. Triangulation of the qualitative findings, observations, and the RCT quantitative findings were integrated and documented with an audit trail. 16-19 Illustrative quotes were selected by consensus with
