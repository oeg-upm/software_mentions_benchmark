The analyses were performed using SPSS software (v.20, IBM), SAS (v.9.3, SAS Institute Inc.) and R (v.2.11, R Foundation). The extent of the WMH penumbra was determined by identifying the plateau phase of each dataset by comparing each CBF, FLAIR intensity, and DTI layer to its corresponding mean total brain value within NAWM using a mixed effects model. We created 15 dummy variables indicating each NAWM layer with total brain NAWM as a reference. The difference in coefficients between two adjacent layers were compared to examine the plateau phase. There is a ''location effect'' of white matter association and commissural fibers surrounding the ventricles resulting in high DTI-FA in NAWM surrounding PVWMH compared with the mean NAWM DTI-FA of the entire brain. 24 Because of this anatomical phenomenon, the plateau phase of this data was determined by comparing adjacent data points using paired t-tests. The first of two neighboring layers whose values were not significantly different from each other was defined as the outer boundary for the PVWMH DTI-FA penumbra. Significant difference was set at p < 0.05. The analysis was performed for PVWMH and DWMHs separately.
