Mice. Four-to six-week-old NOD mice (male and female; Taconic Laboratories, Germantown, NY), female nonobese resistant (NOR) mice, male C57BL/6 mice, and female C57BL/10SnJ mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used. Animals were housed in the barrier facility at the Institute for Cellular Therapeutics (Louisville, KY) and were cared for according to National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. Antibodies. All monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) used in this study were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). c-Kit ϩ Sca-1 ϩ Lin Ϫ (HSC) sorting experiments used the following mAbs: stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) phycoerythrin (PE), c-Kit allophycocyanin (APC), and the lineage panel consisting of the following: CD (4). Briefly, bone marrow was isolated and collected in a single cell suspension at a concentration of 100 ϫ 10 6 cells/ml in sterile cell sort media, containing sterile 1ϫ Hank's balanced salt solution without phenol red, 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 mmol ⅐ l Ϫ1 ⅐ ml Ϫ1 HEPES buffer, and 30 l/ml gentamicin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Directly labeled mAbs were added at saturating concentrations, and the cells were incubated for 30 min and washed with cell sort media. Phenotypic analysis of sorted CD8 ؉ /TCR ؊ FCs. Sorted FCs (purity was Ն95%) were incubated with Fc receptor block (anti-CD16/CD32) before staining with lineage-specific markers: anti-CD11 FITC, CD11b APC, CD14 FITC, NK1.1 FITC, DX5 FITC, B220 PerCP, Gr-1 APC, and CD19 APC, as previously described (4). Sorted FCs were analyzed for p-preDC FCs as B220 ϩ /CD11c ϩ /CD11b Ϫ using Cell Quest Software (Becton Dickinson). DC maturation and cytokine production. FCs were cultured alone or with 1 mol/l TLR-9 ligand CpG-ODN 1668 (TCCATGACGTTCCGATGCT) (Gibco BRL Custom Primers) (13) for 18 h. Supernatants were assayed for cytokines by Linco Diagnostic (St Charles, MO) using LINCOplex Multiplex immunoassay, and cells were stained with anti-CD80, anti-CD86, or anti-MHC class II I-A d (39-10-8) FITC mAbs, with appropriately matched isotype controls. HSC and/or FC transplantation. In the syngeneic model, recipients were conditioned with 950 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) from a Cesium source (Nordion, ON, Canada) and transplanted with 500 HSCs Ϯ 30,000 FC populations by tail vein injection Ն6 h after irradiation (14). In the allogeneic model, recipients conditioned with 950 cGy TBI were transplanted with 5,000 HSCs Ϯ 30,000 FL-PB FCs (4). Colony-forming cell assay. HSCs were cultured at a 1:2 ratio with or without FCs in methylcellulose containing mouse growth factors (MethoCult GF M3434; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) in duplicate at 37°C in 5% CO 2 and a humidified atmosphere (13). After 14 days, colonies containing more than 50 cells were scored. Chimerism testing. Engraftment of donor cells was evaluated by PBL typing using three-color flow cytometry, as previously described (15). FC morphology. Wright-Giemsa staining was performed on cytospins of 100,000 FCs after being fixed in methanol. Slides were examined for dendritic morphology under optical microscopy. Statistical analysis. Experimental data were evaluated for significant differences using Student's t test; P Ͻ 0.05 was considered significant. Graft survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method (4).
