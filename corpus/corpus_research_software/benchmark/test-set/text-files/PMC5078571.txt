GC × GC-TOFMS analyses were carried out on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a split/splitless injector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), cryogenic dual-stage modulator and timeof-flight mass spectrometer (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). In addition, multipurpose sampler with Maestro software (Gerstel, Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany) was used for derivatization and sample introduction. A 10 m × 0.18 mm I.D. Rxi-5 ms (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA) column with film thickness 0.18 μm was used as the first column and a 1.5 m × 0.1 mm I.D. BPX-50 (SGE Analytical Science, Austin, TX, USA) column with film thickness of 0.1 μm as the second column. A phenyl methyl deactivated retention gap column (1.5 m × 0.53 mm I.D.) was installed in front of the first column. The injector was used in the splitless mode at 240°C for injecting 1 μl of a sample. The splitless period was 90 s. High-purity helium (Aga, Espoo, Finland) was used as the carrier gas in a constant-pressure mode with initial pressure of 276 kPa. The first column oven temperature program was as follows: 50°C (isothermal for 2 min) then 7°C/min to 240°C, and, finally, 25°/min to 300°C (3 min). The second dimension column oven temperature was maintained 20°C higher and the programming rate and hold times were similar than in the first dimension. The temperature of the transfer line was maintained at 260°C and ion source at 200°C. Modulation time was 4 s. Electron impact ionization was applied at 70 eV, and the mass range from 45 to 700 amu with 100 spectra/s was measured.
Automatic peak detection and mass spectrum deconvolution were performed using a peak width set to 0.2 s. Peaks with signal-to-noise (S/N) values lower than 100 were rejected. The S/N values were based on the masses chosen by the software for quantification. ChromaTOF version 4.32 (LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, MI) was used for the raw data processing. The peak areas from total ion chromatography (TIC) were used for most of the compounds; for compounds that were quantified with the ChromaTOF software, peak areas of selected characteristic m/z were used.
Next, the data files obtained by the ChromaTOF software were exported to text files and in-house developed software Guineu (Castillo et al., 2011) was used for aligning and normalization of compounds for further analyses. The original GC × GC-TOFMS data includes retention times, retention indices (RI), spectral information (for possible identification), spectral similarity value (S = 0-999), and peak response data. The linear retention indices were calculated based on the total (i.e., sum of the first and the second dimension) retention times of the compounds and the retention times of the retention index standards (n-alkanes). The second dimension retention time is so short (1-3.5 s) that its contribution to the retention index is not significant. The alignment of the data was performed based on retention indices, second dimension retention times and spectra. After alignment of the GC × GC-TOFMS data, two filtration criteria was utilized for positive identification: spectral similarity N850 and maximum allowed difference in retention index between experimental and literature values b25. Only the metabolites detected in over 70% of the samples in each of the four study groups were included in the dataset. This procedure resulted in a total of 465 metabolites. The literature values were obtained from NIST 2008 Mass Spectral Library or they were determined experimentally with GC × GC-TOFMS instrument in our laboratory with authentic standards (in-house developed library). In addition, Golm metabolome database (Kopka et al., 2005) was used for further identification of the metabolites. In cases where the metabolite identity could not be determined with available methods, the chemical class was reported based on the MS spectra (Castillo et al., 2011).
All statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB R2014b (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), applying in-house developed scripts and PLS Toolbox 7.9 (Eigenvector Research, Inc., Wenatchee, WA, USA), and R Statistical Software using rms package (Harrell, 2015).
