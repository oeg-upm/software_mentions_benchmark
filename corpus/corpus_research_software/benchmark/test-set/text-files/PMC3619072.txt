HPV detection. Fresh tumour samples were obtained by biopsy and immediately stored as RNA at À 80 1C until tested. Each sample was used for DNA and RNA detection. Nucleic acids' 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 58, 59 and 68) and low-risk (LR) HPV (types 6, 11, 42, 43 and 44), but does not allow the identification of specific genotypes. As for RNA, samples were analysed for HPV E6 and E7 mRNA by NucliSENS EasyQ HPV v.1 test (BioMérieux, Rome, Italy), based on the NASBA technique. It specifically detects the E6/E7 mRNA of five HR HPV types (HPV16/18/31/33/45); the other HR and LR genotypes are not detectable with this assay. Briefly, three premixes were made by the reconstitution of reagent spheres in the reagent diluent, followed by the addition of primer/molecular beacon mixes (either U1A/HPV16, HPV18/31 or HPV33/45). A measure of 10 ml of premix were distributed to each well, followed by 5 ml sample, and incubated for 4 min at 65 1C and 2 min at 41 1C. The reaction was started by the addition of enzymes and measured in real time using the EasyQ analyser at 41 1C. Data analysis was performed using the EasyQ Director software.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the JMP software, release 7.0.1, from the SAS Institute (Cary, NC, USA).
