Participants were prepared for polysomnographic sleep monitoring using standardized techniques 34 including six EEG sensors to measure brain wave activity placed according to the international system for electrode placement, 35 two eye sensors to record horizontal eye movement (electrooculogram), and chin and tibialis anterior electromyogram sensors to assess muscle activity. Physiological signals were recorded using Nihon Kohden equipment (Foothill Ranch, CA, USA). Other instruments included a nasal airflow sensor, comfortable belts around the thorax and abdomen to monitor respiratory effort, a finger probe to assess pulse oximetry, and a microphone to monitor snoring. Each study session was digitally video recorded. The sleep records were scored according to standardized scoring criteria. 36 The outcome measures of interest are as follows: TST, SE, time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R, and percent sleep period time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R. For data analysis, SPSS version 20.0 was used to perform all statistical analysis, and alpha was set at 0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated. The data were analyzed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Skewness and Kurtosis test, as well as Box plots and normal Q-Q plots. Independent t-tests were used to compare the sleep parameters of the individuals with stroke with the control participants when the assumption of normality was satisfied. Effect sizes were calculated as Cohen's d values. Because this is a pilot study, data are presented without correction for multiplicity. Due to the sex difference in the stroke sample, linear regression was used to study if sex predicts the outcome measure of interest after controlling for age which can be a confounding factor for change in sleep parameters. An exploratory analysis was performed using independent t-tests to compare the sleep characteristics and descriptive characteristics of individuals with left-sided MCA lesions (n=7) to those with right-sided MCA lesions (n=9). Alpha was set at 0.05.
