Because of skewed distributions, the natural logarithmic (ln) transformations were performed for triglycerides. Log-transformed values were reconverted to antilogarithm forms in tables. Medications for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes were coded as dummy variables. Alcohol intake, smoking habits, and history of CAD were also coded as dummy variables. The mean parameters and frequencies stratified by smoking habits were compared using the Mantel-Haenszel x 2 test. Demographic and clinical characteristics of study subjects stratified by gender (Table 1) were demonstrated. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study subjects in both genders stratified by smoking habits adjustment for age were also demonstrated in Tables 2 and 3. Multivariate analysis for AI adjusted for age was performed by a linear regression analysis (Tables 4 and 5). Multiple stepwise regression analysis was performed for independent associated factors of AI (Tables 6 and 7). Adjusted means of AI levels stratified by the 4 groups of smoking status in both genders were compared using multiple linear regression analysis Fig. 1A and B).Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). [17]
