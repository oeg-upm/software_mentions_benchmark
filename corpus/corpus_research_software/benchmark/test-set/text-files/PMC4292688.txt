The data was analyzed using the EVOC (Ensemble de Programmes Permettant L´Analyse des Évocations) (Group of Programs for the Analysis of Evoked Responses) 2003 software, which allows one to achieve the organization of the words based on the hierarchy expressed through the frequency and the natural order of the evocation, through the construction of the Vergès matrix, where the evoked words are distributed, considering the criteria of higher frequencies and mean order of evocation (MOE)(6-7). This corresponds to four quadrants, in which in the top left one may observe the elements with a frequency which is higher than, or equal to, the mean frequency, and with a lower mean order of evocation (evoked more readily). In the top right quadrant, one finds the more important peripheral elements, due to their higher frequencies. In the bottom right quadrant, one finds elements which are less frequent and less-readily evoked, and in the bottom left quadrant there are the elements which, in spite of presenting low frequencies, are considered highly important because of the privileged order of evocation (5).
