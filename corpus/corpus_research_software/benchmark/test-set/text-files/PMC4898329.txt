Data analysis was performed using the SPSS software program version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and were compared by using Student's t-tests. Variables with non-normal distribution were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test, and categorical variables were expressed as percentage and compared by the χ 2 test. The mean renal survival time until the selected end points was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between the calculated mean renal survival times were compared using the log-rank test. The effect of confounders was assessed by Cox regression analysis.
