Multiple-sequence alignments of Cx50 in various species were obtained (Figure 2B). We found that codon 88, where mutation (p.P88T) occurred, is located within a highly conserved region. To date, 33 mutations have been identified in human Cx50; we summarize all reported mutations in Figure 3. The prevalence of changes in proline 88 indicates that this residue is a mutation hot spot. The p.P88T substitution changes a nonpolar residue to a polar residue at this key site in the protein. The online bioinformatics software SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/) predicts a deleterious effect of this substitution. Taken together, these data indicate that the p.P88T substitution is a causative disease mutation rather than a simple polymorphism.
Using DNAMAN biosoftware, multiple-sequence alignment of Cx50 sequences from these species was obtained. Furthermore, we used the online bioinformatics software SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/) to predict whether the amino acid substitution p.P88T in Cx50 could have a phenotypic effect.
