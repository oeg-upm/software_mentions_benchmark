The data collected were entered into a Microsoft Access database (Microsoft Corporation, Washington, USA) and identifiers removed. Fully anonymised data were then exported for analysis in Minitab 16 Statistical Software (Minitab Inc., Pennsylvania, USA), and descriptive statistics were obtained. The questionnaire contained only a small number of open-ended questions. Answers to these were either quantified through frequency counts (i.e. when respondents were asked for details of other toolkits they used c.f. Q.3 and Q.8) or coded manually and organised by type (e.g. for questions asking about 'other categories' not listed, c.f. Q.5 and Q.6). Additional comments obtained through free text were coded manually and organised by theme.
