Statistical analysis of the results was performed by MedCalc software ver. 9.6.2.0 (Mariakerke, Belgium). The results are expressed as mean+standard deviation. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used for comparisons of same-group paired data. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant. With small sample sizes in groups, only very strong differences between groups can be detected.
