Rank sum and F tests were used for the comparison of ps-Tg and ps-Tg/TSH values. The Kruskal-Wallis and F tests were used for comparisons among the three groups; the Mann-Whitney U and F tests were used to compare any two groups. The most sensitive and specific ps-Tg values for distinguishing each of the two group comparisons were obtained using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Gender (female or male), age (<45 years or ≥45 years), tumor size (maximum diameter ≤1 cm or >1 cm), multifocality (single lesion or multiple lesions) and ps-Tg level (<corresponding cut-off value or ≥corresponding cut-off value) were involved as independent variables of recurrence and distant metastasis. These factors were further analyzed using logistic regression analysis to identify if ps-Tg was an independent predictive factor for discerning different recurrence risk groups, and if distant metastases existed. A P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All of these statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (Version 17.0, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and R project (Version 2.15.1).
