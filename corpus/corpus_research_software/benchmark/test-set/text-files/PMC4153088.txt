Wald and likelihood ratio tests were used to assess the statistical significance of observed associations (P < 0·05, twosided tests). The fit of the models was evaluated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow and the Pearson χ 2 goodness-of-fit tests. All analyses were performed using the statistical software systems SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.) and Stata version 12 (StataCorp LP).
