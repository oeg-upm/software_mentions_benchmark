All relevant data were recorded by the pharmacist in an internal database, using IBM SPSS for Windows 20.0. Patient data were documented by assigning an individual patient number, case number, gender, age and date of observation. In order to enable the evaluation, the initially documented ADRs were coded numerically according to the system organ classes (SOCs) of the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) terminology, and the specific symptom. Also, corresponding causality categories were entered numerically. For every documented ADR and week, a single data set containing patient details, medication, daily dosage and causality category for every given AED was generated. Where the same ADR was documented more than once for one patient, the first documented observation and accordingly the one with the lowest AED dosages was included for analysis only. For patients without ADRs, the highest AED dosage was considered. To rule out possible input errors, the data were entered twice at different times. Asserted discrepancies were clarified by re-checking the record forms.
