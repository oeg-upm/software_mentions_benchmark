We hypothesized that we could suspect the degree of liver fibrosis by calculating liver enhancement heterogeneity in the HB phase, and accordingly, developed new MATLAB (R2012a, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA)-based software to identify inhomogeneous signal intensities calculated from a coefficient of variation (CV) map to objectively quantify liver parenchymal heterogeneity.
In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the heterogeneity of liver parenchyma on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR images, using CV value processed by our MATLAB-based software, and to demonstrate a correlation between the calculated heterogeneity and the calculated serologic markers including APRI and FIB-4, which have been known to have diagnostic accuracy for predicting hepatic fibrosis in CHB patients.
To measure hepatic fibrosis quantitatively, we developed a MATLAB (R2012a, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA)-based software to calculate a CV map, as suggested by Li et al. (21). The following procedure was used to calculate the CV map: bias correction of intensity inhomogeneity, followed by calculation of the CV map by dividing the CV value by each pixel value in the circular region of interest (ROI; diameter = 40 pixels) and, finally, calculating the mean value on the CV map (Fig. 1).Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced axial images obtained during the HB phase MR image were obtained in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format and stored on console containing the MATLAB-based program. For quantitative measurements of liver parenchymal heterogeneity, two abdominal radiologists (with 24 years of experience and with 4 years of experience in abdominal imaging), blinded to clinical information and pathological fibrosis grades, performed the procedure by positioning separate circular ROIs (diameter = 40 pixels) on the selected MR images, which was bias-corrected. In all subjects, ROIs were placed on the anterior segment of the right hepatic lobe with no overlap over large vessels and focal lesions such as cysts or tumors (Fig. 2). Each radiologist measured ROIs 3 times in the selected MR images and calculated the mean.
Optimal cut-off values were selected using a common optimization step that maximized the Youden index for predicting significant fibrosis; sensitivity and specificity were calculated from the same data without further adjustments. The inter-observer agreement was performed based on the intraclass correlation coefficient. The KruskalWallis test, Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlation coefficients, and intraclass correlation coefficient were conducted using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and ROC, sensitivity, and specificity were analyzed with MedCalc version 15.6 (MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium).
