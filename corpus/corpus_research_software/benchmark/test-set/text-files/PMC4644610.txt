Data were analyzed using SPSS version 13. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine whether the quantitative variables were normally distributed. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations) were calculated for compliance with quality indicators. Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between nurses' compliance with auditing indicators and their age and work experience. Independent-samples t-tests were used to compare the mean compliance scores of nurses by dichotomous demographic variables.
