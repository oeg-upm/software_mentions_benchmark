The statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS software version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Baseline demographic values were calculated with the Kruskal-Wallis test, then the post-hoc test was performed. The continuous variables were summarized as mean Â± standard deviation (SD), or minimum (min) and maximum (max) for certain categorized values. Correlation analyses were done with Pearson's correlation test. P values of < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant.
