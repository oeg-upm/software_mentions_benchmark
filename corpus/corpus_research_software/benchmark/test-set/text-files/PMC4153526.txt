The mean and standard deviation of patient's age, disease and follow up duration, in addition to pre-and post-operative BFMDS scores were calculated. According to the normal distribution of data, the paired t-test was used to compare changes of the BFMDS before and after surgery. We correlated post-operative BFMDRS with patients' age, disease duration, age at the time of surgery and pre-operative BFMDRS.A probability value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. The SPSS software version 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used for the statistical analysis.
