Blood was sampled on different occasions for assessment of a full set of hematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters as well as cytokines and complement. Cytokines (IFNa, IFN-c, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-a) were assessed prior to dosing and at 2 and 7-8 h after dosing). For RTR2996, total complement activity (CH50) was assessed on day 15 before dosing and at 0.25 h and 24 h after dosing. Additionally, urine was collected in a metabolic cage for 16 h (RTR5001 and RTR4955) or for 24 h (RTR3649 and RTR2996), before first dosing and towards the end of the dosing period. Hematology parameters were determined using a Sysmex V R XT instrument (Sysmex, Japan), coagulation parameters with ACL TOP500 (Instrumentation Laboratory, USA), and clinical chemistry parameters with an Advia 180 (Siemens) automated system. Urinary chemistry parameters were measured with an Aution Max TM AX-4280 instrument (Arkray Clinical Diagnostics, USA) and an Advia 1800 (Siemens) automated system. Cytokines were determined by ELISA using the Porcine Cytokine Chemiluminescent 9-plex Array Kit on an AS0034 Imager with the SignaturePLUS TM imaging system and the PROarray analysis software (all Aushon SearchLight, USA) according to provider's instructions. In the results significantly altered parameters when compared with control and/or pretest values are presented.
Group means and standard deviations (SD) were calculated for N ! 3 minipigs per group using Provantis software (Instem Life Sciences, Stone, UK). Differences between the control group and treated groups were determined using an ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Values of P < .05 were considered statistically significant.
