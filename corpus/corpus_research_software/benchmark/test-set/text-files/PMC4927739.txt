1. Use the in-house written software "ccEBSD" programmed by Paul Chekhonin for the evaluation of the recorded EBSD patterns. 2. Choose an appropriate EBSD pattern that will act as the reference pattern from a measuring point that should be located in a specimen area absent of strains. 3. Apply at least 15 widely distributed regions of interest on the pattern. 4. Use the coordinates of the pattern center and the detector distance which were determined by the EBSD control software for the further evaluation. 5. Enter the rest of the parameters relevant for the evaluation, i.e., elastic constants of the analyzed material, number of steps in the line scan and step size, detector size and its resolution in pixels, detector and specimen tilt angles as well as the detector binning. 6. Use a band pass filter during the calculation of the 2-dimensional Fourier transformation (inner filter of 6 pixels and outer filter of 40 pixels). 7. Run the evaluation program. 8. Read out the numerical results from the evaluation text file "protocol.txt" using a conventional spreadsheet program when the calculation is finished.
