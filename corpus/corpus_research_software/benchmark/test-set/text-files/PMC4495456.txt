The CS of the coronary arteries was measured for each calcified plaque using a software program (Vitrea 2, Vital Images, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Image processing, including vessel segmentation, was performed to create multiplanar images and to visualize the entire vessel segment with the narrowed lumen. The cross-sectional images of the vessels could be obtained from any point throughout its length by moving the mouse cursor. The quantitative evaluation of stenosis was based on the ratio between the lumen with minimum contrast and the unaffected proximal and distal lumens with the normal reference.
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results were expressed as mean and standard deviation. Differences in continuous variables between groups were compared using the unpaired t-test when the variable had a normal distribution and the Mann-Whitney test when distribution was not normal. Categorical variables were summarized as percentages and comparisons between groups were carried out using the chi-square test. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The logistic regression models were used to study the association between significant coronary lesions, multivessel involvement, CS â‰¥ 100, plaque types and risk factors for CAD. The analysis was adjusted for age, gender, DM, SAH, dyslipidemia, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking and family history of CAD.
