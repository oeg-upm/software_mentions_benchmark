The amplified sequences were compared with the GenBank (NCBI) database using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) algorithm. Using a calculated percent identity score, specimens were assigned to a genus and species, as previously described [6, 7]. Briefly, a sequence was assigned to a species if the best matching reference sequence showed ≥ 98% homology and the next best matching reference species showed 0.8%, or less, sequence homology. A sequence was assigned to the genus level on the basis of 95% to 98% homology to the best matching sequence or ≥ 98% homology with sequence entries for several species from the same genus. 'No identification' was defined as < 95% homology with the best matching reference sequence or a sequence homology > 95% with various genera. Discrepant results between phenotypic and sequence-based identification methods were resolved by repeating the sequencing and re-evaluation of the phenotypic method.
