Feasibility studies are not designed to detect a treatment effect and analysis should be mainly descriptive or concentrate on confidence interval (CI) estimation [14]. Data (mean, CIs) are presented below for interest even though the study was not powered to detect an effect of the intervention. Questionnaire feasibility was determined via participant acceptability, mean duration for completion (minutes), and standardised response means (SRM), a measure of the sensitivity of each questionnaire to detect change. SRM was calculated as mean change in scores or values divided by the standard deviation in change scores [15]. The SRM provides the relative magnitude of mean change compared with the variability of change, with higher SRM values indicating greater sensitivity. BMI and waist circumference measurements were converted to SDSs using UK 1990 growth references [16]. For selection of a primary outcome for the multi-centre trial (based on the ability of BMI, waist circumference, and BIA to predict DXA), multiple linear regression modelling was used, starting with a full model and using backwards selection, to identify which variables were predictors of DXA fat mass after adjusting for age and gender. Model assumptions were checked (normally distributed residuals and constant variance) and, when necessary, variables were log transformed to improve model fit. The models that best predicted baseline DXA (those with the most significant predictors and the highest R 2 value) were then applied separately to the 6-and 12-month DXA results in order to see how well the models predicted fat mass. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
