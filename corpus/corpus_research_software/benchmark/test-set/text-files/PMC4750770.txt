Multiple regression: Due to the possible clustering on operating surgeon, we used mixed linear regression models to estimate the intraclass correlation of the clustering on operating surgeon. We found that there was no statistically significant intraclass correlation. Thus, linear regression with robust standard errors using the STATA command "cluster (cluster variable)"was used-which relaxes the independence assumption and requires only that the observations should be independent across the clusters (STATA 2013). Overall satisfaction was treated as the outcome and comorbidities were treated as the independent variables. LOS, age group, and gender were coded as dummy variables (Table 2), and were tested for interactions between LOS and comorbidities. Statistically significant interactions were included in the final analysis. Of the 9 surgeons who performed the operations, each per-Several times a day / Once a day / Several times a week / Once a week 9. How satisfied were you with the information you received before surgery a ?: 10. How satisfied were you with the rehabilitation you received from the physiotherapists and the nursing staff during admission a ?: 11. How satisfied were you with the pain treatment you received during admission a ?: 12. How satisfied were you with the information you received during your admission a ?: 13. Were you satisfied with the length of your stay in hospital?: Yes / No, I would have preferred a longer stay / No, I would have preferred a shorter stay / Don't know 14. How well-informed did you feel about the time after discharge a ?: 15. How satisfied were you with your discharge procedure a ?: 16. How satisfied were you throughout the first few weeks after discharge a ?: 0-10 17. How was your overall satisfaction with the entire process a ?: a (on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is not satisfied at all and 10 is best possible satisfaction) (5) 13 (6) formed a mean of 48 (8-79) operations. It has been shown that a random variation exists between surgeons (Randsborg et al. 2010). We therefore checked to determine whether the operating surgeon should be included as a random variable, taking into account the random variation across surgeons using linear mixed-effect model analysis.
The statistical assumptions for a linear mixed-effect model analysis apply to both the between-subjects and within-subjects effects. The between-subjects assumptions are the same as those in a standard regression analysis: the independence of scores, normality of the residuals, and equal variances (known as homogeneity of variance). As this was not the case, we applied cluster robust standard errors using the HubertWhite sandwich estimator. This relaxes the assumption of independence, thus producing "correct" standard errors (in the measurement sense) even if the observations are correlated. Even so, caution is needed in interpreting the results. In addition, the mixed model also assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, equality of variances of the difference scores for all pairs of scores at all levels of the within-subjects factor, and equal covariances for the between-subjects factor. This assumption is known as the sphericity assumption. Sphericity is especially important for mixed model analysis. Bartlett's test for sphericity was performed to test for this, and it showed no statistically significant departure from the sphericity assumption. Thus, we decided to assess the intraclass correlation of the model using a linear mixed model with robust standard errors-as the assumptions for this model appeared to be fulfilled. If a statistically significant intraclass correlation was evident, a mixed linear regression model was used; if not, then "normal" OLS linear regression with robust standard errors was used. As no significant intraclass correlation was found, a "normal" OLS linear regression with robust standard errors was performed and q-q normal plots were used to check for normality of the residuals of the model. STATA 13 and SPSS 17.1 were used for the analyses.
