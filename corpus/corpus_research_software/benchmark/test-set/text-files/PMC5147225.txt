Four patients (2 syndromic craniosynostosis, 1 cranial defect, 1 distal radius deformity secondary to arthrogryposis) were included. CT scans (â‰¤1 mm slices) were obtained (DICOM file) for volumetric conversion to 3D models (STL file) using free open-source software (3D Slicer, http://www.slicer.org). The resulting STL files were uploaded to the MakerBot desktop application for printing with the MakerBot Replicator 2 ($2,750, MakerBot Industries, Brooklyn, NY). Material cost and printing time were recorded for comparison to alternative manufacturing methods. The 3D models were used to guide pre-operative planning and intra-operative reconstruction.
