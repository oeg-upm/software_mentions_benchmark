All measures were coded so as to be consistent such that higher values indicate more positive orientations toward e-cigarettes and the likelihood of their use. Descriptive analyses used appropriate measures of central tendency and dispersion. Cronbach's alpha was used to assess scale reliability. Tests for differences and associations were done so as to separate the effect of student status and smoking status due to their conflation. Factorial ANOVA was used to compare differences in means across student status and smoking status, with effect sizes calculated (h 2 ). Partial correlations (r and eta) controlling for smoking status were used to assess associations within student status and to compare associations across student status. Across-group comparisons of associations were tested using Fischer's r-to-z transformation. Data were weighted for comparison of student and non-student groups. All analyses were conducted using Stata 13. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics and tests of differences between students and non-students, without regard to smoking status. The groups were equivalent in terms of sex, but non-students were somewhat older. There were no significant differences on the race/ethnicity Brief Reportmeasures. While the percentages of former and occasional smoking were equivalent, a significantly greater proportion of students were never smokers, while a significantly greater proportion of non-students were daily smokers. On electronic cigarette use, a greater proportion of students were never vapers and a grater proportion of non-students were occasional vapers. There was not a significant difference at P<0.05 in the percentage of dual users (among the 144 current smokers, which might support a relaxed alpha in which case the rate is higher among non-students). Non-students were also significantly more approving of public smoking, had a greater intention to use electronic cigarettes, and reported greater information exposure on electronic cigarettes. There were no significant differences on the remaining items (public vaping, attitude, norms, and innovation). Table 2 reports the simultaneous effects of smoking status (ever versus never) and student status on the eight variables of interest, with allowance for interaction terms. Significant differences were found for each variable conditioned on smoking, with uniformly small-to-medium effect sizes. Student status showed no main effects. Two significantinteraction effects were found, however, as reported in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1. A cross-over interaction was found for information exposure in which student ever smokers scored higher than nonstudent ever smokers and student never smokers scored lower than non-student never smokers (meaning, students who smoked had more exposure to information about e-cigarettes, but students who didn't smoke actually had less exposure to information about e-cigarettes than non-students). Also, student ever smokers scored higher on alternate tobacco use than did non-student ever smokers, while the never smokers were equivalent across student groups. A closer look revealed that hookah use was dominant. Among ever smokers, the hookah use score was significantly higher among students (1.97 versus 1.61, t(191)=3.1 P<0.01), with 58.3% of the non-students having never tried hookah, compared to 27.4% of students (χ 2 (3)=23.5 P<0.001). Further examination also shows a higher rate of vape/hookah dual use. Among the student ever smokers who vape some days or every day, 50% use hookah some days or every day. The rate among non-students is half that, 26.3% (χ 2 (4)=17.6 P<0.01). Table 3 reports partial correlations among the eight variables of interest, controlling for smoking status. Separate correlations were run for students and non-students. The Fischer r-to-z transformation was used to test for differences between coefficients. No significant differences were found, thus the correlations can be interpreted as equivalent. Different sample sizes account for some of the borderline contrasts between the groups (approximately r=0.10 required for significance). Despite no contrasts between student and non-students, the correlation analysis does reveal some interesting results. The variables can be considered as five attitudinal and two behavioural measures (with intention in the latter with alternate tobacco use). Each of the attitude measures presents a significant association with both of the behavioural measures, with the exception of information with intention. Of note, attitude, norms, innovation, and information have medium-to-strong associations with the two key variables of interest: behavioural intention to use an electronic cigarette and acceptability of public vaping.
