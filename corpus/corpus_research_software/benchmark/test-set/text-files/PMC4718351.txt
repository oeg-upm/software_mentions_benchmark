â€¢ discharge before case fall. The computerized system GIPSE (Management Information First Aid and Emergency) has been used for detection of controls, it is a technical tool for the computerization of Emergency Services, and disclosures discharge required by SIES (Emergency Medical Information System). The search criteria considered to determine the controls have been the department, the event date fall (admissions have been considered starting from the four days before case fall) and gender. Medical folders have been identified by SDO codes that stemmed entering this information into GIPSE program.
Each folder has been analyzed independently by two reviewers using the data extracting form preformed. Medical records evaluations were compared and any disagreement has been resolved with the help of a third reviewer. Finally, data collected by extraction form have been inserted in an Excel file. In the statistical analysis, possible associations between patient falls and variables have been evaluated using Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Student's t, MannWhitney and odds ratio (OR), with confidence intervals (CI) at 95%. The level of significance for all analyzes has been setted at p < 0.05. A conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between the outcome of being a case or a control and the set of prognostic factors (intrinsic and estrinsic). Parameters were estimated using conditional method for matched data [21]. The model fitted only included covariates resulted significant at univariate analysis. The likelihood-ratio test has been applied to evaluate the goodness of model. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0.
