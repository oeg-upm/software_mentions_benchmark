Datasets in each series were analyzed by Gene- Spring software (v7.3.1; Agilent) using GCRMA normalization and with the cross-gene error model activated. In each case, samples were grouped as normal or diseased, and a parametric t-test was per-formed to obtain genes with statistically significant differences. The p-value cutoff was set at 0.05 and a Benjamin Hochberg False Discovery Rate correction was included. These restrictions would allow about 5% of the tested genes on the GeneChip (total 54,675) to qualify by random chance. This gene list was further filtered to obtain genes that showed at least a two-fold differential expression between the normal and diseased states, which generated between 1,300 to 3,700 differentially expressed genes for the four cancer datasets (Table 1). Protein sequences corresponding to these genes were obtained from GenBank and UniProt databases.
PPIs associated with differentially expressed cancer genes were used to create networks with the application of Cytoscape program (v2.3.2) (http:// www.cytoscape.org). Semantic similarity provides a quantitative measure of how similar a pair of proteins are, based on the annotations (GO terms) in a given GO category. This method has been proved to be very effective in interpreting the functional similarities of genes based on gene annotation information from heterogeneous data sources (42 , 43 ). In our study, the semantic similarity between the molecular functions or the biological processes of two proteins involved in a PPI was calculated following the literature (43 ) and only those PPIs with a high semantic similarity value of 4.0 or more (5.5 being the highest) were used to create interaction networks under each GO term category.
