The data collectors were already ART-trained health professionals who were actively working in ART care clinics in the region. They were trained for 3 days. The training sessions included the purpose of the research and pilot testing of the data collection tools and processes. The format and other technical features were amended as deemed necessary after pretesting. All members of the research team acted as supervisors during the entire data collection period.or death after initiation of ART across independent variables. Because of the competing outcomes of death and LTFU, the cause-specific Cox models commonly used for time-to-event analysis would yield biased estimates. Therefore, the multivariate analysis and estimation of the cumulative incidence of LTFU and mortality were performed using competing risk regression models taking the other events of interest as the competing event. The data were entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software, saved as Stata version 8SE, and exported to Stata statistical software (Stata Corporation, Release 12, College Station, TX, USA). The regression analysis and cumulative incidence of LTFU or death was conducted using Stata version 12.0. We decided a priori to include selected variables in the multivariate model. Missing data for each factor was modeled as a separate category. For all statistical tests, the level of significance was set at a type I error of 0.05.
