Time-lapse imaging. Time-lapse images of monolayer cells were acquired at 1-h intervals for 72 h on a BIOREVO BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Images of spheroids were acquired at 1-h intervals for 72 h using an FV10i-LIV confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) in an agar-spread culture dish containing growth medium. During imaging, cells and spheroids were kept at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO 2 . For quantitative analysis, fluorescent areas were measured using the ImageJ 1.44 software (available at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Flow cytometry analysis. All samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde to detect DNA contents and the fluorescence intensity of monomeric Azami Green (mAG) or monomeric Kusabira Orange 2 (mKO2). After washing in PBS, cells were stained with PBS containing 10 lg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 30 min. Samples were analyzed using a FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).
