The cine MRI images used in this study were selected from records obtained to evaluate deglutitive tongue move ments in patients with open bite and Class II malocclusions. 18,19 This study was initiated after obtaining institutional approval from Gulhane Military Medical Academy's Ethics Committee (1491-373-07). Images of 36 patients with normal overjet (1 -3 mm) were selected.G*Power software (v3.1.3; Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany) was used to determine the power of the sample size. 20 A sample size of 36 patients was considered sufficient to provide more than 60% power for detecting significant differences with an effect size of 0.30 between groups at a 0.05 significance level.
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows (version 15, IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,USA). The Shapiro-Wilks and Levene tests were applied to the data and mean ages, which were both found to be normally distributed and showed homogeneity of variance between groups. Therefore, parametric tests were performed for further analysis. Within-group differences in the stages of deglutition were analyzed with the pairedsamples t-test. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the differences between groups and the significance of the interaction between stages and groups. p â‰¤ 0.05 was considered significant.Descriptive statistics of the measurements are presented in Table 1. In this table, mean values and standard deviations of the measurements according to the stages are shown for both OBG and CG.
