The following methods were used for statistical analysis: STATISTICA release 10 from Stat Soft Poland, SAS System 10.0 SAS Institute Inc. Institute of Rheumatology, Warsaw, Poland. Normal distribution data have been presented as mean and standard deviations, whereas abnormal distribution data as median and interquartile range. Depending on their distribution, data were analyzed using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney u test. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Cohen's Îº coefficient with linear weighting was used to measure agreement between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP values. In order to assess the variation between DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP, the Bland-Altman plot was used.
