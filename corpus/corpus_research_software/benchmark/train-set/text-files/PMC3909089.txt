It is also interesting to find out whether the activities of downstream components of SOS2-SOS3 complex oscillates and coincides with diurnally regulated SOS2 and SOS3 transcripts. One of the downstream components, regulated by this complex is CCR1 (cold-circadian rhythm-RNA binding1) which encodes a Gly-rich RNA-binding protein. CCR1 has similar expressionRNA extraction and northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from tissue using TRIzol method as per the manufacturer's instructions (T9424; Sigma-Aldrich). Northern blots were prepared using 20 μg total RNA. Appropriate probes [partial for OsSOS1(AK065608) corresponding to its N-terminal part and full length for other genes; OsSOS2 (AK102270); OsSOS3 (AK101368); OsTOC1 (AK111828)] were amplified using the primers listed in Table 1 and radiolabeled using the DecaLabel™ DNA labeling kit, (K0621; Fermentas). To avoid any error due to unequal loading of RNA samples, same blot was re-probed each time with different gene probes after washing. Northern blots were hybridized at 65°C in 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA for 16-18 h. Membrane was washed twice in 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min each at 65°C and scanned on phosphorimager using the software Fujifilm Image Reader. The relative transcript abundance was calculated using the Image Gauge (Fuji Photofilm Co. Ltd.).
