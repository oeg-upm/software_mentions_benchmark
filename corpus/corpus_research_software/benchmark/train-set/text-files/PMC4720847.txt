All analyses were performed with SPSS (version 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data are expressed as meanÂ±standard deviation for continuous variables and as percentage ratio for categorical variables. Categorical variables were compared by chisquare test. If more than 20% of cells had a count less than five in the chi-square test, a Fisher's exact test was performed. Continuous variables were compared by Student t tests. If the data did not show a normal distribution, a Mann-Whitney U test was performed. A p less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
