Electrical test system. A PXI bus test system was constructed to provide high stable powers for the sensors and to precisely measure the collecting currents from pA to nA. The test system based on PXI bus was consisted of a 14-Slot Chassis (NI PXI-1044), a controller module (NI PXI-ExpressCard8360), five digital multimeter modules (NI PXI-4071), and three power modules (NI PXI-4132). The three power modules provided voltages needed for the electrodes (Fig. 1c). Two of the power modules were connected in series to provide 0-150 V voltage for extracting electrodes of the sensors, and the other power module provided 0-100 V voltage for collecting electrodes. The digital multimeter modules with shielded cables are capable of acquiring the collecting currents from pA to nA for five sensors at the same time. All acquired data were recorded to a computer through a LabVIEW program linked to MXI interface.
