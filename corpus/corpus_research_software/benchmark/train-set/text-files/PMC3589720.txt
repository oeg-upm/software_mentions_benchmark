Sequences for 4 shRNA were designed to target the 39 untranslated region of genes, and 2 of them were selected (Supplementary Table 5 1 were cultured without feeder cells in standard media. After expansion, these cells were co-transfected with 1.6 mg of shRNA expression vector and cultured with puromycin starting at 24 h after transfection. Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. We selected 72 h time point as a trade-off between two objectives: (a) to capture early responses of target genes and minimize indirect responses, and (b) to observe robust changes in gene expression. The early time point (48 h) was not chosen due to relatively weak responses: only 111 genes changed their expression by .5-fold, as compared to 256 and 579 genes at 72 h and 96 h, respectively. The late time point (96 h) was not chosen, because it may include the response of many non-target genes that are affected indirectly. In particular, almost 1/2 of genes (48.3%) that changed their expression by .2-fold at 96 h did not respond at earlier time points (Supplementary Figure 1). The proportion of GFP-positive cells in culture, measured by flow cytometry, was high enough (.74% for all shRNA) to justify using all cells for gene expression profiling. We chose not to use sorted cells because sorting often results in cell damage followed by the induction of stress-related genes. RNA was extracted with Trizol TM (Invitrogen). Efficiency of knockdown was quantified by real time qPCR, microarrays and Western blot (Fig. 1c, d); primers and antibodies are listed in Supplementary Tables 6, 7. Gene expression was profiled with NIA Mouse 44 K Microarray v3.0, Agilent Technologies, #015087 23. The data was batchnormalization for compatibility of experiments. Microarray data are submitted to GEO/NCBI (GSE26520). Two shRNA were used for the majority of TFs and we treated them as biological replications using ANOVA. Some of these experiments included also 2 technical replications where cells were split after transfection cultured separately and RNA was hybridized to separate microarrays. Further details on cell manipulation and data analysis can be found in the project website: http://esbank.nia.nih.gov/. For statistical analysis we used NIA Array Analysis, which estimates the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to account for multiple hypothesis testing 24. All genes shown as significant in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S2 satisfy stringent statistical criteria (FDR , 0.05, fold change .2). Response of genes to the knockdown of TFs was measured as a logratio (i.e., difference between mean log-transformed expression in the knockdown experiment and global median expression). Principal component analysis (PCA) of log-transformed gene expression was done using genes that showed statistically significant change in their expression (FDR , 0.05) with SVD method applied to the covariance matrix of log-transformed gene expression values within the NIA Array Analysis.
For the heatmap (Fig. 5b), we selected 2046 named genes (excluding olfactory receptors and Riken clones) with .1.5 fold median change following the knockdown of Pou5f1 and Sox2 (trajectory 1) or knockdown of Esrrb, Sall4, Nanog, and Tcfap4 (trajectory 2). These genes were then classified into 6 response groups as follows: if the logratio of gene expression change was .2 fold greater following one trajectory that another trajectory, then the gene was considered specific to the former trajectory. A small number of genes (N 5 18) responded in opposite directions following trajectories 1 and 2. We classified them according to the strongest absolute value of the median logratio of gene expression change. Within each group, genes were sorted using hierarchical clustering, TMEV, ver 3.1 27.
