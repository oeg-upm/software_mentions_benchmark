Protein expression was determined using Western blot. Briefly, following the incubation periods, HUVECs were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Applygen Technologies Incphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes. After centrifuging the lysates at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes, the supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C for future use. The protein concentrations of these extracts were determined by performing a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Equal amounts of protein samples (40 µg) were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham plc, Amersham, UK). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk buffer and incubated with anti-p-p38, anti-p-p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), anti-JNK (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal antibodies; Bioworld Technology, St Louis Park, MN, USA), anti-p-38 (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal antibodies; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), and anti-β-actin (1:1,000, a mouse polyclonal antibody), (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) at 4°C overnight, washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G/antimouse IgG secondary antibody at 37°C for 1 hour. The antibody-bound proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Quantification of the Western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) data were performed by measuring the intensity of the band using the ImageJ analysis program (Image J, NIH).
The data are expressed as the means ± standard deviation or means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical comparisons of the means were performed using one-way analysis of variance with SAS 6.12 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The differences were considered to be significant when the P-value was ,0.05.
