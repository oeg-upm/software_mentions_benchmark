Normally distributed data was expressed as mean Â± SD, and non-normally distributed data was expressed as median and interquartile range. Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis was performed to evaluate relationships between R60 minutes and other metabolic variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify factors contributing to R60 heart rates. We performed all statistical analyses using the SPSS ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. Figure 2 shows the relationship between HOMA-IR and R60 heart rates.
