Microarray data was analyzed by minfi [10] and shinyMethyl [11] packages available through Bioconductor [12]. Single cytosine methylation values (β-values) in each sample were calculated as the ratio of the methylated signal intensity to the sum of methylated and unmethylated signals. Methylation values ranged from 0, fully unmethylated, to 1, fully methylated cytosine. Raw methylation β-value plots were performed for all samples to identify possible deviant samples (Fig. 1 & B).
Microarray methylation data was normalized by missMethyl package [13] using the SWAN (subset-quantile within array normalization), a within-array normalization method for Illumina Human Methylation 450k BeadChips (Fig. 3).
