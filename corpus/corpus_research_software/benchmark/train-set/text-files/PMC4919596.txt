In the majority of cases, individual env variant's IC 50 s was a mean of 3 independent assays. Comparisons within an individual were done using Wilcoxon rank sum test. For comparisons across multiple individuals, the median IC 50 for strains with specific co-receptor usage was determined for each subject. Inter-subject comparison were done using Kruskal Wallis test, and pair-wise inter-subject comparisons were done using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The matched pairs Wilcoxon rank sum test was used when all individuals had variants with the coreceptor usage being compared. All statistical analysis were done using Stata version 8.0 (Stata Corporation). All p-values are based on two sided tests.
