Live confocal imaging Embryos were electroporated with 0.75 mM ContMO or Sip1MO (FITC labeled) + 1.5 mg/ml membrane RFP and/or nuclear RFP. They were imaged in the Lab-Tek chambered 1.0 borosilicate coverage glass system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coated with <0.5 ml 0.6% low-melt agarose mixed with Ringer's solution. Embryos were maintained at 37°C during imaging. A confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta or LSM 710; Carl Zeiss) was used with an LD C-Apochromat 40×/1.1 W Corr objective (Carl Zeiss). Time lapses were done with a z total = 31 µm to leave space for z-drift. Time points were collected at 5-min intervals. Subsets in the z-plane containing the cells of interest were selected for clarity. Collected time-lapse data were registered using Imaris software (Bitplane) to account for embryo drift and exported as TIF images and MOV videos. The registration correction (processed with Imaris software) for embryo drift results in the changes in movie shapes seen here. Cell tracking in Imaris was done in the FITC (green) channel. Parameters used included a spot diameter of 5.19 µm and the "Connected Components" algorithm for tracking.
