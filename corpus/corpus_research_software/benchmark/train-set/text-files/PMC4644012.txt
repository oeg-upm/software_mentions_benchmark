Several reports have demonstrated that the VITEK 2 GN card misidentifies P dagmatis as P pneumotropica or P canis, despite an excellent identification probability (9,15,23,24). This is most likely because P dagmatis has not been included in the system database; as well, there has been a nomenclature change because P dagmatis was formerly grouped with P pneumotropica, type Henriksen. In a study that included 66 clinical Pasturella isolates and used sodA gene sequencing as a reference method, Zangenah et al (24) revealed that VITEK 2 only identified approximately 50% of Pasturella isolates correctly, while conventional biochemical tests and MALDI-ToF MS were able to correctly identify 94% and 89%, respectively. Interestingly, in the Zangenah et al (24) study, two P dagmatis isolates were not identified by VITEK MS MALDI-ToF (BioMerieux, France) and this limitation was also observed in our study (data not shown). The biological and genetic profiles among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica and P stomatis are very similar (Table 2); both a commercial biochemical identification system and the sequence analysis of a portion of the 16S rRNA gene were unable to differentiate between these species.
Correct identification was made using MALDI-ToF MS (MALDI Biotyper, Bruker, Germany) and was also supported by comparing the key biochemical characteristics among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica and P stomatis Table 2). It is probable that many clinical isolates of P dagmatis have been misidentified due to the limitation of commercial biochemical identification systems, such as VITEK 2. Misidentification may have contributed to an underestimation of the frequency of this organism in clinical samples; however, the growing use of MALDI-ToF MS systems for microorganism identification in routine clinical microbiology laboratories may allow for a more accurate picture of how frequently P dagmatis causes infections. Correct identification is important for diagnosis and therapeutic management, and epidemiological monitoring of the transmission of Pasturella species, particularly for the systemic infections such as in the present case. Unfortunately, most routine methods available at hospital laboratories cannot identify the organism correctly.
P dagmatis can cause severe animal-associated infections in humans, mainly in immunocompromised individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first systemic P dagmatis infection reported in Canada. Clinical outcomes rely on early accurate laboratory confirmation and timely administration of effective antibiotic treatment. Conventional identification of P dagmatis using VITEK 2 can be misleading, probably due to the absence of this organism from the database; 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MALDI-ToF MS systems represent excellent options for identifying rarely encountered or difficult to identify organisms, such as members of the Pasturellaceae family. The present study re-emphasizes the need for continuously improving the database of automatic microbial identification systems.
