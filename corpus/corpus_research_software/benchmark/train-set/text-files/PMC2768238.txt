The nucleotide sequence of 1,287 samples aligned with CLUSTAL W (European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK) software, 11 and the results acquired were and used for phylogenetic tree analysis after artificial adjustment. Reference sequence, which was downloaded from Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database (Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM, USA), was used to identify the subtype of obtained sequence; Genetic distance between sequences was assessed using the software MEGA 3.1 Kimura 2-parameter (Center for Evolutionary Functional Geromics The Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ, USA), 12 and phylogenetic tree was reestablished with neighbor-joining method.
