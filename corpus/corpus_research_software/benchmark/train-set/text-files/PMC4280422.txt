For statistical evaluation the software NCSS 8 was used. For comparing the quantitative data we used either the two-sided t-test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney, or the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To evaluate the qualitative data we used the c 2 test of independence in a contingency table or Fisher's exact test. Values of p were obtained with the likelihood-ratio test and considered significance if < 0.05.
