Samples of ECM materials were rinsed in Dulbecco's PBS (pH 7.4). Samples (25-30 mg) were hermetically sealed in aluminum crucibles. Thermograms were recorded using differential scanning calorimeter (Model Q2000; TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) from 2°C to 125°C at various heating rates between 0.02°C/min and 50°C/min. After calorimetric measurement, small holes were punched on sealed crucibles with a pin, and the dry mass of samples was measured after dehydration between 105°C and 110°C under vacuum overnight. Thermograms were analyzed using the software Universal Analysis 2000 (version 4.5) to determine the onset temperature (T d ) and enthalpy (ΔΗ) of collagen denaturation.
De-convolution of the fresh porcine dermis calorimetric thermogram. The complex thermogram (A) are deconvoluted into individual peak components (B) using a mathematical software PeakFit (PeakFit 4.12, Systat Software, San Jose, CA), so that the changes of peak temperature and percentage area of individual components could be evaluated after tissue processing. Peak temperatures and their percent enthalpy values are mean ± standard deviation. Peak A disappears after cell lysis in water and a wash in phosphate-buffered saline, suggesting its origin of cellular proteins and loosely bounded ECM proteins. Minimally processed porcine dermis ECM retains Peak B and Peak C, without any change in their onset and peak temperatures.
