We summarized the patient characteristics and used analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables to investigate differences in baseline characteristics among the three groups. Changes in %WL, %EWL, %EBMIL, and AWL were summarized at 0 (baseline), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months, and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated. ANOVA was used for the statistical testing of outcomes among the three groups at each time point. To reduce data entry error, two people independently input data into the data collection forms, which were developed using  Microsoft Access software ( 2007). Subsequently, the accuracy of the inputted data was checked with SAS and corrected. Statistical data analysis was conducted with SAS software (9.2, SAS Insti- tute, Cary, NC, USA).
