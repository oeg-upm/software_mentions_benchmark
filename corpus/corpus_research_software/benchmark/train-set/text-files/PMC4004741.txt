The sequence data is run through filtering and analysis pipelines, such as QIIME (qiime.org), in order to define operational taxonomic units and is compared to bacterial 16SrRNA databases (such as Green Genes, http://greengenes. lbl.gov/cgi-bin/nph-index.cgi) to determine the bacterial diversity of the sample. Depending on the goals of the course and the experience of the instructor, the filtering and taxonomic assignments can be done with the students. Alternatively, these steps can be performed by the instructor outside of the class and the taxonomic classification and relative abundance data can be used in class. Many of the academic and commercial sequencing facilities will perform filtering and basic analysis of the raw sequence data. Classes that do not have a wet lab component can analyze data collected by students in other courses or data collected by other investigators.
