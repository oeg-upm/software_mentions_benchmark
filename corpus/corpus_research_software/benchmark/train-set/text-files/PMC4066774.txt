â€¢ C at 200 rpm, passage of the eluted cDNA through a 0.45 m filter and ethanol precipitation. The quality and size distribution of the amplified libraries were confirmed by electrophoresis on Agilent DNA 500 Bioanalyzer microfluidic chips. Libraries were quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KK4824, Kapa Biosystems). The libraries were pooled at equimolar concentrations and diluted to 13 pmol prior to loading onto the flow cell of the cBot cluster station (Illumina). The libraries were extended and bridge-amplified to create single sequence clusters using the TruSeq SR Cluster Kit version 3 -HS (Illumina). The flow cell carrying amplified clusters was loaded on the HiSeq 2000 sequencing system (Illumina) and sequenced with 50-bp single-end reads using the TruSeq SBS Kit version 3 -HS (Illumina). Ten percent X174 phage DNA was spiked into all sequencing lanes for sequencer calibration. Real-time image analysis and base calling were performed on the instrument using the HiSeq Sequencing Control Software. CASAVA software version 1.8 (Illumina) was used for de-multiplexing and production of FASTQ sequence files.
The FASTX application (www.molecularevolution.org) was used to trim adapter sequences from the 3'-end of the sequence read, discard any sequence of <17 nts after trimming and to collapse identical reads into single entries retaining the read count for each unique sequence. Non-redundant sequences were then aligned to genomic RNA and mRNA sequences of hg19 using Bowtie 2 (www. bowtie-bio.sf.net) (35) and matched sequences were retained and aligned to common and abundant non-coding RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, snoRNAs). Remaining sequences were further aligned to known mature and precursor miRNAs using the miRbase 19 database (www.mirbase. org). Additional alignments to a transcript database ( Ensembl version 75, http://www.ensembl.org) (36) and the specific piRNA database piRNABank (http://pirnabank.ibab. ac.in/) were also performed (37). Alignment result files were parsed using the R statistical language (http://www. R-project.org) and the Bioconductor project (http://www. bioconductor.org) (38) to generate tables including the read count and annotation information for each entry in the target database. Raw read counts for each RNA class from all samples in the study were then joined in raw data tables. The raw reads were converted to reads per kilobase of target length per million mapped reads (39). All sequences were deposited into the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/geo/) under accession number GSE56076. Calculation of percent of reads by biotype was based on raw read counts of perfectly matched transcripts for each biotype compared to total reads for each library.
Abundance of RNA biotypes in SE across donors was analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. The difference in RNA content between exosomes and seminal plasma was tested using a paired t test. All statistics were calculated using Prism 6.0 (Graphpad).
