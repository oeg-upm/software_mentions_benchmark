Retrospectively, we analyzed the purified mononuclear cell fractions of the first (MDS-diagnosed) and second (ALL-diagnosed) BM specimens using microarray analysis, Affymetrix Cytogenetics Whole Genome 2.7 Mb Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to identify genetic abnormalities. In the first BM sample, no chromosomal or genetic abnormalities were observed. However, in the second BM sample, we found several large interstitial deletions of 27 Mb and 5.7 Mb on 5q21.2q31.1 and 13q14.1q21.1, respectively, and many microdeletions on chromosomes 5q, 12q, 13q, and 22q. Particularly, a partial homozygous loss of 200 kb was observed in a region of heterozygous loss on chromosome 13q14.1q21.1 in the second BM sample. The chromosome views of the second BM sample using cytogenetic microarray analysis are shown in Fig. 3. To confirm this result, additional FISH analysis of the second BM sample was performed using 2 probes for EGR1 (5q31) and RB1 (13q14), and produced the same result: 5q31.2 was not deleted and 13q14.3 was deleted in 84% of the examined nuclei (Fig. 4).
