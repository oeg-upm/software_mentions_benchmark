To identify proteins from the gel, the bands on the gel were excised, digested in gel, and subjected to liquid chromatography equipped with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described previously (Ishizuka et al. 2010). In the case of identification from the solution for shotgun proteomics, the proteins were digested in solution, and subjected to LC-MS/MS as described previously (Kubota et al. 2009compiled by the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the Mascot program (Matrix Sciences, London, UK). A label-free spectral counting method, emPAI (Ishihama et al. 2005), was used to quantify identified proteins in shotgun proteomics.
