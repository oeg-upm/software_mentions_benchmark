The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay is frequently used in radiation biodosimetry to estimate unknown doses by correlating the rate of micronuclei (MN) per binucleated cell (BNC) in peripheral blood lymphocytes to a dose (4,5). The assay is traditionally performed using manual microscopy and is capable of generating accurate and reproducible dose estimations between 0.3 and 4 Gy (6-8). A number of studies have illustrated that linear-quadratic dose response calibration curves can be obtained using automated or semi-automated slide scoring with the MNScore software module on the Metafer slide scanning platform (MetaSystems, Germany) (7-10). The results of these works indicated that the overall MN frequency in these curves was reduced at higher doses (3 or 4 Gy) by a factor between one and a half and three when compared to manual slide scoring. The reduced number of MN in automated slide scoring appears to be related to the strictness of scoring criteria in image analysis that can cause MN that would be typically scored manually to be missed. For example, MN that are in very close proximity to the main nucleus may be missed by automated systems (8,10). This is a limitation to the sensitivity of the assay and its applicability in the low dose region; however, it is less of an issue for rapid dose estimation in the higher dose regions.
The IS X is capable of capturing high-resolution images of individual cells at a rate of up to 5,000 cells per second. The new IS X -CBMN method is able to process cell samples suspended in solution and eliminates the need to create microscope slides, thereby reducing the time required for sample preparation (17-19). All images captured on the IS X are saved to a data file which is analyzed using the Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS V R ) built specifically for the IS X . Previously, we generated dose response calibration curves from 0-4 Gy (17,19) and 0-10 Gy (18) but in both cases, while a large number of BNCs were scored (about 2,000), a reduction in MN frequency by a factor of about 5-10 was observed when compared to curves generated by automated and manual slide-scoring methods respectively. This paper describes the optimization of the IDEAS analysis template for identifying and scoring BNCs and MN in the IS X -based version of the CBMN assay. In this work, we reanalyzed existing data in order to demonstrate improvements in the accuracy of identifying and separating BNCs from other cells and cellular debris, as well as improved detection of MN through the use of a newly developed MN mask. The resulting increase in MN frequency is evident in the improved dose response calibration curve in which the rate of MN per BNC is comparable in magnitude to those presented by other authors using automated slide-scoring versions of the CBMN assay. Finally the improved accuracy of the template is evidenced by the re-analysis of blinded samples to generate dose estimations to within 60.5 Gy of the delivered dose following only 5 minutes of data collection on the IS X .
Blood Collection and Irradiation, the CBMN Assay and Data Collection on the IS X Blood collection, irradiation, and processing was performed previously as described by Rodrigues et al. (17-19) and all data was saved as raw image files for analysis in IDEAS (version 6.2). For the dose response calibration curve, peripheral blood was collected with informed consent (approved by Health Canada's Research Ethics Board) from healthy, non-smoking anonymous donors (three male and three female between the ages of 27 and 48). For the blinded samples, nine blood samples were collected from five healthy anonymous donors (males between the ages of 34 and 56 years of age) in 6 mL lithium-heparinized Vacutainer V R tubes (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, ON) with the same health and historical radiation exposure criteria as described above. Each whole blood sample was then irradiated to a known dose between 0 and 4 Gy and blinded before culture. The doses were 0,
In IDEAS, a mask identifies pixels within a defined region of in an image. Optimized BNC and MN masks were developed by applying and combining several new and existing mask functions in IDEAS (version 6.2). The steps to create both masks are outlined below.
To filter, identify and score BNCs and MN, an optimized analysis template using new features and image masks developed by Amnis V R was created in IDEAS. ToOriginal Article quantitate the gating process, separate populations containing 100 BNCs and 100 non-BNCs were selected at each dose point for one donor by manually highlighting (tagging) images from the original unfiltered population without visualizing the analysis area in IDEAS. This ensured unbiased selection of images. BNCs and non-BNCs were tagged according to the traditional scoring criteria described by Fenech et al. (9). These events (BNCs, yellow; non-BNCs, blue) were then identified on each panel in Figure 3 such that they could be tracked sequentially through the template. This allowed gate dimensions to be optimized such that no more than 10% of the BNC population was gated out in any plot and as many as possible non-BNC events were gated out. Details of the features, functions, masks and gating strategies used to optimize the data analysis template are summarized in Table 1. To automatically count the frequency of MN within the final BNC population, the SPOT COUNT feature was applied to the newly developed MN mask and a histogram of MN frequency was generated Fig. 4), similar to the histograms generated in our previous work (17,18). Representative images are also shown to demonstrate typical events found in each bin.
Six independent experiments with six different donors were carried out in a previous study to generate a dose response calibration curve (18). In the current study, the data files from that work were re-analyzed with the optimized IDEAS template described above to demonstrate improvement in detection and scoring of BNCs and MN.
However, the deviation from the average rate of MN per BNC was calculated to be only 15% on average for all donors across the dose range, compared to 26% in our previous work (18). The average rate of MN per BNC (Y) as a function of dose (D) was fitted to the following quadratic equation in Matlab: (27). These curves were plotted using the quadratic equations provided by the authors and demonstrate the variability between calibration curves using automated slidescoring based versions of the CBMN assay. In addition, Figure 5B demonstrates that the rate of MN per BNC has increased by a factor of about six at the 4 Gy dose, illustrating the effectiveness and accuracy of both the optimized BNC and MN masks.
Figures 5C and 5D show graphical representations of the delivered dose (Gy) versus the estimated dose (Gy) (black circles) for all nine blinded samples after collecting data on the IS X for 40 and 5 min, respectively. Also plotted are the dose estimations from our previous work (19) (black squares), the ideal line with a slope of 1 where the delivered dose and the estimated dose would be equal (dashed line) as well as the 60.5 Gy lines (dotted lines). All dose estimations were determined using CABAS v2 (Chromosome Aberration Calculation Software) (28) and the error bars represent the standard errors (SE) on the dose estimations. Figure 5C illustrates that after 40 min of data collection, the newly optimized analysis template was able to estimate blinded doses to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose in all but the 0.73 Gy sample (0.59 Gy higher than the delivered dose). The error bars associated with each data point are also within the 60.5 Gy lines in all but the 0.73 Gy sample. On average, 1,873 BNCs were scored for each sample after 40 minutes of data collection. Figure 5D illustrates that after only 5 min of data collection, optimized analysis template was able to correctly estimate more blinded samples to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose than was possible with the original analysis template. Seven of the nine blinded samples were estimated correctly towithin 0.5 Gy as compared to only three of the nine samples with the original analysis template. On average, 280 BNCs were scored for each sample after only 5 minutes of data collection.
In several recent publications, we have introduced a newly developed method for performing the CBMN assay using imaging FCM as a dose estimation tool in radiation biodosimetry (17-19). In the present study, we developed a new analysis strategy using mask functions recently implemented in IDEAS, and evaluated the performance of this analysis compared to our previous approach. First, hand-tagged truth populations (BNC and non-BNC, MN, and non-MN events) were selected which allowed for the identification of features that were able to distinguish between these populations. Direct visualization of the locations of these populations (Fig. 3) also allowed for ranges of all features to be optimized. Second, we discovered that an analysis template optimized for a single data file was, in many cases, not ideal for all conditions. By merging data collected from multiple donors at multiple dose points, the most optimized analysis template for all data files was achieved. Finally, data collected from blinded samples was used to confirm the accuracy of the optimized analysis. These strategies enabled us to substantially increase the comparability of this assay to previous published results in the literature and improve accuracy when generating dose estimations compared to our previous work. Figure 3 shows the sequential application of bivariate plots and histograms in the analysis template and demonstrates the effectiveness with which BNCs could be separated from cellular debris and other undesired objects in the data acquired by the IS X . While identification of focused, single cells can be attained from the BF images, the addition of a DRAQ5 nuclear stain also allows apoptotic cells to be gated out based on the hallmarks of apoptosis (chromatin condensation, nuclear condensation, and increased blebbing) without the use of an additional viability dye (13). All DRAQ5 stained BNCs were shown to fall between 1 3 10 5 AU and 1 3 10 6 AU of intensity indicating that the main nuclei show a relatively uniform uptake of DRAQ5. This result may allow for improved data collection to be obtained through the application of more stringent intensity classifiers on the IS X which would filter out more unwanted events during acquisition. Furthermore, the newly created BNC mask was able to better differentiate images with two DRAQ5 stained objects from those with zero, one or three or more DRAQ5 stained objects compared to the previous versions of the IDEAS template. Several of the new features developed in IDEAS that simultaneously compare the main nuclei to one another based on circularity, size, staining intensity and symmetry, allowed BNCs to be further differentiated from other undesired events. By implementing these cell-specific parameters in the IDEAS template, 99% of the tagged non-BNCs were correctly filtered from the final population on average across the dose range. In addition, 25% of the tagged BNCs eliminated with the original template were recovered and 83% of the tagged non-BNCs retained with the original template were eliminated. Figure 5 demonstrates that the optimized IDEAS analysis template generates a dose response calibration curve that is of similar magnitude to those presented in the literature and that the dose estimations from blinded samples generated using this curve are more accurate. The rate of MN per BNC as a function of dose demonstrates some variability between donors. This variability in the CBMN assay has been well documented in the literature and Kacprzak et al. (29) showed that for five donors, the rate of MN per 1,000 BNC was relatively consistent at 0 Gy but had an approximate range of 0.2-0.6 at 5 Gy. While the variability between donors across the dose range has been reduced in this work to 15% compared to 26% in our previous analysis template (18), the need for generating a calibration curve that is based on the rate of MN per BNC from multiple donors is demonstrated. In addition, the magnitude of the rate of MN per BNC in this work has increased by a factor of about four in comparison to our previous work, on average, across the dose range, illustrating the effectiveness of the optimized BNC and MN masks. In previous versions of the IDEAS analysis template, MN close to the main nuclei and smaller MN could not be scored due to the limitations in the available masking parameters, however the optimized MN mask is now able to correctly score these events which has led to the observed improvement.
In order to determine if the improvement in BNC and MN identification corresponded to an increase in accuracy when generating dose estimations, data acquired from nine samples previously irradiated and blinded (19) were reanalyzed. Figure 5C demonstrates that the optimized IDEAS analysis template was able to correctly estimate eight of the nine doses to within 0.5 Gy after 40 min of data collection, with only the 0.73 Gy sample falling outside the 60.5 Gy limits. Figure 5D illustrates the improved accuracy of the optimized analysis template and demonstrates that dose estimations for seven of the nine doses were correct to within 0.5 Gy after only 5 min of data collection. This is a significant improvement over the original analysis template which was only able to correctly estimate three of the nine doses to within 0.5 Gy following 5 min of data collection. On average, 280 BNCs were scored for each blinded sample after only 5 min of data collection, but in some cases, <200 BNCs were scored. McNamee et al. have previously recommended that 200 BNCs be scored to provide reliable dose estimations (23). Furthermore, in a recent publication De Amicis et al. were able to successfully identify doses up to 4 Gy, within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose by scoring only 100 BNCs (30). The results of this work are consistent with the results of De Amicis et al. and demonstrate that scoring approximately 100 BNCs was sufficient to produce accurate dose estimations between 0 and 4 Gy. Overall, this demonstrates that the newIDEAS analysis template is able to provide dose estimations with acceptable accuracy (within 60.5 Gy) after only 5 min of data collection and in some cases, after scoring only 100 BNCs.
This paper has introduced the application of new features and masks developed in the IDEAS software designed specifically for improved detection of BNCs and MN in the IS X -based version of the CBMN assay with applications in radiation biodosimetry. Using these tools, an optimized data analysis template was created which more effectively identified BNCs and quadrupled the frequency of scored MN across the 0-4 Gy dose range. This new analysis method allowed for the generation of a dose response calibration curve that was similar in magnitude to those presented in the literature which were generated by automated slide scoring methods. Finally, dose estimations of blinded samples were correctly generated to within 0.5 Gy of the delivered dose following only 5 minutes of data collection on the IS X , a marked improvement over our previous work. The improved analysis template, combined with the reduction in data collection time on the IS X , will allow for increased accuracy and throughput when performing biodosimetry to estimate unknown radiation doses received by exposed individuals following large-scale radiological or nuclear emergencies.
