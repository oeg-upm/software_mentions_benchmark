For comparisons with WF, the disk was removed and a neutral density filter with a transmission factor of 6% (ND6) was put into the illumination path to adjust the image brightness. The image was projected onto the camera via a 5× magnifier and taken by 2 × 2 binning mode. Thus the pixel size of the specimen is 43 nm with a 60× objective lens, satisfying the Nyquist condition for up to 100-nm resolution. The software package MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to control the system and for acquisition of the image.
