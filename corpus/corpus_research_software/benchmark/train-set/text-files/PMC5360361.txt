The mRNA expression levels of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were determined by RT-PCR. Briefly, SK-N-SH cells were treated as mentioned above, and the total RNA of each group was extracted using TRIzol agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two micrograms of total RNA was first reverse transcribed into cDNA, and then routine PCR was performed as previously described (22). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control and products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel. ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) was used to quantify the optical density value of each band. The sequences of specific primers (Sangon Biotech Inc., Shanghai, China) used for RT-PCR are listed in Table I.
Western blot analysis. Cells were collected at 24 h after exposure to H 2 O 2 . In order to detect the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, SK-N-SH cells were washed with PBS and lysed using a lysis buffer for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C, and the supernatant was saved for the total protein determination. Protein concentrations were determined using a commercially available BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). For western blot analysis, equivalent amounts of protein of each sample (20 µg) were electrophoresed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature, primary antibodies (in TBST-5% BSA) against Bcl-2 (1:2,000; 12789-1-AP) and Bax (1:5,000; 60267-1-Ig) (both from ProteinTech Group Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) were added and incubated overnight at 4˚C for determining signal transduction events. The membranes were rinsed three times with TBST and incubated with an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000; #04-15-06 and #04-18-06) (both from KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 1 h at 37˚C. An ECL kit (Millipore) was used to visualize membrane immunoreactivity. Quantification was performed using a computerized imaging program Quantity One (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
