Western blot analysis. The LF cells were lysed using SDS lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 10 min at 4˚C. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4˚C with rabbit monoclonal antibody specific to CTGF (1:400; ab6992), p-p38 (1:1,000; ab47363), or p38 (1:400; ab27986). All antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA). Following 3 washes, the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (A0208; Beyotime) for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was performed with luminal chemiluminescent systems. Quantitative data were obtained using a computing densitometer and MultiGauge software version 3.0 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).#4412; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence staining was imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) as previously described (26).
