The source files were internal member-level files at each Data Partner that included only claims that were adjudicated or, if no reimbursement was expected, recorded. They were refreshed by Data Partners in the last half of each month and normally included data on healthcare events through the end of the prior calendar month. Approximately every 2 months, 3-4 times during 2013-2014, each Data Partner translated their source files to standard-format patient-level files including all medical and pharmacy claims with service/fill dates â‰¥ 1 September 2012. A distributedSAS program aggregated data into a vaccine file and a diagnosis file, each with a summary count of the cumulative number of members in each stratum defined by week of vaccination, age group, sex, and other variables.
