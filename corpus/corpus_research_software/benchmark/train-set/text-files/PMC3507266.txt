Cardiac output from a seated resting baseline estimated preservation of cardiac function. Impedance cardiography signals were recorded via a Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph (Model HIC-3000, Bio-Impedance Technology, Chapel Hill, N.C., USA) using a tetrapolar band-electrode configuration. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from the Hutcheson Impedance Cardiograph using disposable ECG electrodes. The basal thoracic impedance (Zo), the first derivative of the pulsatile impedance (dZ/dt) and the ECG waveforms were processed using specialized ensemble-averaging software (COP, BIT Inc., Chapel Hill, N.C., USA), which was used to derive stroke volume using the Kubicek equation. Following instrumentation, Impedance cardiographic signals were recorded for seven 40-second periods during a 10-min resting baseline. Finally, all cardiac output measurements were divided by body surface area, yielding cardiac index ( table 1 ).
