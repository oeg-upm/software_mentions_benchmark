The morphological features of the cultured HPCs were observed under phase-contrast microscopy (ECLIPSE TS100, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) during the entire culture period, and cultures were evaluated on the basis of cell shape and size, colony formation, cell density, cytoplasm to nucleus ratio and colony size. Images were acquired and processed using digital imaging software (NIS-Elements F3.0).
For transcriptional profiling of HPCs, the high-density microarray GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, CA, USA) was used to characterize mRNA expression following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cultured HPCs and primary hepatocytes using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Single-and double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from qualified total RNA samples using the GeneChip 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix). Three samples of total RNA (200 ng) pooled from five different specimens of each cell type were used for cDNA synthesis. After double-stranded cDNA cleanup and a quality check, in vitro transcription was performed using the GeneChip IVT Labeling Kit (Affymetrix) to produce biotin-labeled cRNA from the cDNA. The Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays were hybridized at 45 °C for 16 h at 60 rpm with a hybridization cocktail containing 15 µg of fragmented and labeled cRNA in a hybridization oven (Affymetrix). The arrays were then washed and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SAPE, Molecular Probes, OR, USA). All hybridization assay methods, including the preparation of solutions, were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The distribution of fluorescent material on the array was detected using a 3000 7G GeneChip Scanner (Affymetrix). Mi- croarray Suite version 5.0 and GeneChip Operating Software supplied by Affymetrix were used for gene expression analysis. The pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze global gene expression similarities between human HPCs and hepatocytes. The specimens were hierarchically clustered by inputting the probe sets/genes that exhibited a greater than 20-fold change between HPCs and hepatocytes.
Only those genes detected as present or absent in triplicate arrays were reported as expressed or non-expressed genes. The data were analyzed by the chi-square test using SPSS software version 16.0. The level of significance for all statistical analyses was P < 0.05.
