All experiments were repeated at least three times. The results were expressed as mean Â± SD. Data were analyzed using SPSS 13.0. Value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Student's t-test was used to compare two means. To compare multiple means, one-way analysis of variance in conjunction with Dunnett's test was performed.
