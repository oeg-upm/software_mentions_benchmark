Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to compare these variables between healthy control subjects and patients or the responsive and non-responsive groups. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and proportions, and tested with Fisher's exact test. Median regression was employed to compare non-normally distributed continuous variables adjusting for other variables. The Wilcoxon signedrank test was used to compare the cytokine values of pre-and post-antidepressant treatment. Relationships between two continuous variables were tested by Spearman's correlation analysis. p-values were corrected by Bonferroni's correction for the multiple association tests of cytokines and noted as corrected p. All differences were considered to be significant at p<0.05. Statistical analysis was undertaken using STATA SE 10.0 for Windows (College Station, TX, USA).
