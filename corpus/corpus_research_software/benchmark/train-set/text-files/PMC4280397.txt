A relevant size discrepancy was defined as a size difference of >1 cm between CESM measurements and histopathological results, in line with previous publications [12, 13] and concordant with margins used by our surgeons. A 2x2 contingency table was created for both imaging modalities and their corresponding size estimations. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics (version 20.0,IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). All p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
