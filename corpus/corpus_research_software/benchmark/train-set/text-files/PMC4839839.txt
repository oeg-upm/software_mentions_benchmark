The data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, 2014) and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CAM) version 3.3.070 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Each class of antiretroviral was considered in a separate analysis of the association between adherence and virologic failure in randomized clinical trials. Results are presented based on 9 categories, including study region, antiretroviral regimen, treatment experience, virologic failure cut-off points, adherence cut-off points, adherence measurement, study design, observation period, and year of publication. Adherence pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effect model (DerSimonian and Lard) 9 that accommodated the random variation within studies and between-studies. 10 Heterogeneity between-studies were examined using the Q and I 2 statistics. 9,11 The odds ratio was plotted against the inverse of standard error to identify the risk of publication bias by visually assessing the symmetry of funnel plots. Statistical significance was confirmed using Egger's test, 12 with a P value <0.05 considered suggestive of publication bias. A metaregression was performed to examine major moderators of the between-studies heterogeneity. Results with P values <0.1 from univariate analyses were included in the multivariate meta-regression model.
