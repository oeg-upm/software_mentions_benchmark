The follow-up for each patient included chest radiography, laboratory tests, and CT. For evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, the absence of enhancement inside the tumor was taken to indicate technical success. A follow-up CT was conducted at intervals of 1, 3, and 6 months and then every 6 months over the years. One-month follow-up CT was performed to determine whether there was any remnant or residual enhancement of the ablated lesion. Complete treatment resulted when nonenhancement was achieved. The technical success rate was defined as complete ablation of the tumor following the initial procedure or additional sessions with a 1-month follow-up. Recurrence was defined as growth of the tumor or any new enhancing portions at 3 months after confirmed nonenhancement of the initial RFA lesion. Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson's chi-square test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance between the two groups were used for analysis of the characteristics of each group. A p-value ï¼œ0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed by using IBM SPSS ver. 18.0 (IBM Co., Armonk, NY, USA).
