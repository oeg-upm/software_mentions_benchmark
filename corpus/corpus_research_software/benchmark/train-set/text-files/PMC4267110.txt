Categorical variables were reported as percentages and compared by Ï‡ 2 test, whereas continuous variables were reported as means and SDs and compared by analysis of variance, if normally distributed, or by the Kruskal-Wallis test, if not. Temporal trends were tested using the Cochran-Armitage test for binary variables and the Kendall Tau rank correlation coefficient with the Jonckheere-Terpstra test for continuous variables. The 95% CIs of the difference of percentage changes were evaluated using the R package proCIs. Since the baseline patient characteristics showed significant changes in the five registries, we calculated a risk score for the 2010 MANTRA population using a logistic regression model resulting statistically significant at univariate analysis or considered of clinical interest. These variables included gender, age, diabetes, history of heart failure, prior stroke/transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, prior renal failure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, Killip class and atrial fibrillation at admission. This score, evaluated on the 2010 MANTRA population, was also used to standardise the death rates for each of the previous surveys. The standardised death rates therefore represent the rates that would have been expected if the distribution of the baseline characteristics of each of the first four surveys had been similar to that of the most recent one.
All tests were two-sided; a p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted with SAS system software V.9.2 and with the 'R' Development Core Team 2012.
