All recordings were performed at room temperature (22°C) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and acquired with Pulse and Patchmaster software (HEKA). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass, fire-polished to a resistance of 0.5-1 MΩ, and covered in dental wax to reduce linear capacitive currents.
was fitted to the 10 2 -10 3 range of normalized conductance to yield a lower bound estimate of the voltage dependence. Data analysis and model fitting were performed using custom scripts written in Igor Pro 6 (WaveMetrics).
Sequence alignment and structural model building Shaker and Kv1.2 amino acid sequences were aligned using AlignX in the Vector NTI software package (Invitrogen). The structural model of Shaker was constructed using the I-TASER protein structure prediction server, with the 1. All of our patch-clamp recordings of ionic and gating currents were performed in the cell-attached configuration to maximize patch stability and avoid voltage shifts that have been reported to be present in Kv1.2 channels when recorded in excised-patch configurations (Rezazadeh et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2012). Nevertheless, we observed some variability in channel behavior. Most currents behaved as those ionic potassium (K + ) currents depicted in Fig. 1 A. Large amplitude currents could be routinely measured, with activation that speeded up with depolarizing voltages, as has been reported for other voltage-gated K + ion channels and previously for Kv1.2 (Scholle et al., 2004). Occasionally, faster onset currents could be recorded, which also activated over a more negative voltage range (not depicted). These less common currents are related to the more typical ones shown in Fig. 1 by an approximate 15-mV voltage shift, both in kinetics and steady-state properties. This observation is similar to what has been shown to occur to Kv1.2 in mammalian cell expression systems (Rezazadeh et al., 2007) and to the Kv1.2-Kv2.1 paddle chimera (Schmidt et al., 2012), where fast and slow populations of channels can be distinguished. In our recording conditions (symmetric K + ), the I-V curve shows a negative slope region, indicative of voltage-dependent activation Fig. 1 B). The voltage dependence of activation was estimated from the amplitude of tail currents at the end of a depolarizing pulse. The normalized magnitude of the tail current is shown in Fig. 1 C, along with a fit to a fourth-power Boltzmann function, with an apparent gating charge per subunit of 2.7 e o .
