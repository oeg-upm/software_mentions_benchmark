Histological examination. Samples from each group (n=10) were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde solution. Following the process of decalcification and dehydration, the muscles were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-µm sections and stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Muscle fibers (≥100 in each group) were observed in bright-field using Nikon ECLIPSE TS100 light microscope (Tokyo, Japan) and Nikon D7200 image acquisition system. Their diameters were measured using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
PDQuest v 8.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) software was used to calculate the intensities of protein spots to identify differentially expressed proteins. To correct quantitative variations in the intensity of protein spots, spot volumes were normalized as a percentage of the total volume of all the spots present in a gel. Only spots that were consistently present in the gels from at least three rats in each group were analyzed to avoid spot differences that were due to gel-to-gel or biological variation inherent among the rats. The protein molecular weight, which ranged from 10 to 100 kDa, and the isoelectric point (pI), which ranged from 3 to 10, of each protein spot were calculated by the software using the distributions of standard markers and pI positions, respectively.
Selected protein spots were excised from the gel and cut into ~1 mm 2 pieces. Samples were destained using 50% (vv) acetonitrile (ACN) and 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (100 µl, pH 8.0) for 15 min, this was repeated three times until the destaining process was complete. The gel samples were dipped into 100% ACN (30 µl, pH 8.0) for 5 min until they turned white. They were dried at room temperature and the samples were then digested using trypsin (8 µl, 0.005 mg/ml) at 37˚C for 16 h. The digested proteins (0.3 µl) coupled with 0.3 µl matrix were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis using a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) to obtain the peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) with 4,600 laser intensity. The peak list was generated by GPS Explorer v 3.5 software (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and searched using Mascot (version 2.1.0; Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK). The PMFs were processed by using the NCBI databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the fingerprinting method was applied allowing a maximum of one missed tryptic cleavage per protein. The protein score confidence calculated using the Mascot algorithm. Confidence score ≥95% and P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Significant differences were determined by ANOVA testing. SPSS software version 22.0 was used for data analysis (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
