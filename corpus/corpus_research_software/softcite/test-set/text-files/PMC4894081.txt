The sample size was calculated using G power 3.1 software. Based on the information drawn from a study by Akcan et al. (27), the mean PIPP score was considered 10 with a standard deviation of 2. Assuming the equality of variances of PIPP scores in the intervention groups, alpha error of 5%, and statistical power of 80%, the required sample size to detect a difference of two scores between the groups was estimated to be 24. In order to increase the statistical power, and considering sample attrition, it was decided to include 30 neonates in each group.
All statistical tests were carried out using SPSS statistical software, version 20 and the graphs were drawn usingSTATA statistical software version 11. The significance level was considered 0.05 in all tests.
