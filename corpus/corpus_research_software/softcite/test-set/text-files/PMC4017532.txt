To convert the NMR data into a form that can be useable in statistical procedures firstly the FIDsalready have been fourier transformed to the frequency domain-manually phased and baselinecorrected applying XWINNMR or other (1). Then the NMR data are usually transformed into a matrix in which a sample and a metabolic signal pertain to a row and a column, respectively. The spectral intensity at a particular chemical shift corresponds to the estimated level of a particular metabolite. The Carr-PucellMeiboom-Gill (CPMG) spin-echo pulse sequence, π/2-t D -π-t D , was used for serum samples (9). CPMG experiment can enhances visualization of the low molecular weight metabolites and to suppress the broad signal from the protein (9). Spectral regions within the range of 0.2 to 10 ppm were used after deleting the region containing residual water and urea signals (4.5 to 6.0 ppm) (10). Biological fluids such as serum, plasma and urine have been used for studies of crohn's disease. Serum and plasma are the most common fluids in metabonomics surveys. These samples are also relatively easy to obtain.
In some researches, for each samples 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS) was added as internal reference substance (δ=0 ppm). Also peak of the lactate methyl doublet (δ=1.33 ppm) or other metabolites are referenced within XWINNMR for spectra (16). Scaling is a column-each spectral intensity across all samples-operation that including mean center, auto scaling, pareto scaling etc. Mean centering includes subtracting the column mean from each value in the column and given a mean of zero. Second scaling is auto scaling also called unit or unit variance scaling; in
