Mutation analysis. To identify mutations in AKT1, direct sequencing was performed as described (Pansuriya et al, 2011), using DNA derived from 57 tumours, 8 cell lines and 1 primary culture (L3310) using forward primer 3 0 -TAGAGTGTGCGTGGC CTCTCA-5 0 and reverse primer 3 0 -CTGAATCCCGAGAGGCC AA-5 0 to screen for hotspot mutations in the AKT1-E17K pleckstrin homology domain.
Statistical analysis. Survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. Values of Pp0.05 were considered statistically significant. Variables that achieved significance (Pp0.05) were entered subsequently into a multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model. Cox regression analysis was carried out with clinical outcome (overall survival) as the independent variable. Correlation between expression and grade and individual stainings were evaluated using Pearson chi-squared test for independent variables. Values of Pp0.05 for asymptomatic two-sided testing were considered significant. The data were analysed using SPSS version 17.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA). For combination assays, the combination index according to the method of Chou and Talalay (1984) was calculated. A combination index (CI) of below 1 indicates synergy, and CI of above 1 indicates additive effect. Correlation between combination indices was evaluated using independent two-sided t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 software (La Jolla, CA, USA). Values of Pp0.05 were considered significant.
