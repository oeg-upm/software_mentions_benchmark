Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 21.0. Fracture frequencies in the thoracic spine (1st to 9th thoracic vertebral body), the thoracolumbal junction (10th thoracic to 2nd lumbar vertebral body), and the lumbar spine (3rd to 5th lumbar vertebral body) were recorded. Statistically signifi cant differences in frequencies (p < 0.05) were revealed by using the chi-square test for independent data and Cochran's Q-test for dependent data. Gender differences in the distribution of fracture localization were expressed as frequencies and compared with the chi-square test.
