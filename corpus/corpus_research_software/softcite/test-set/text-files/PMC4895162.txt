EITL was defined as a primary intestinal T-cell lymphoma with characteristic morphology, typically with cytotoxic, CD3+ CD8+ CD56+ EBER − phenotype. Five snap frozen primary tumors and matched whole blood samples were obtained from the SingHealth Tissue Repository. The patients were recruited from 2010 to 2014 and all provided signed informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An additional 41 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples collected from 2003 to 2014 were obtained from the following centers: National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore General Hospital, National University Hospital and Tan 19,20 Only Integrative Genomics Viewer-true mutations were considered somatic and variants with frequency ⩾ 15% were further validated by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table 2).
Prevalence screening was performed for GNAI2, JAK3 and STAT5B genes in 42 tumor samples using amplicon deep sequencing. Only common hotspots reported in COSMIC v.72 and regions identified through WES were sequenced for each gene (Supplementary Table 3). CREBBP mutation frequency was determined in a partial prevalence cohort (16 cases) using Single Primer Enrichment Technology (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA, USA). SNP genotyping array and allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors Genomic DNA from four tumor-normal pairs was hybridized to GenomeWide Human Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Array 6.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) chips. Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors was performed as described previously. 21 Stable cell line construction and western blot Full-length GNAI2 cDNA was amplified using AccuPrime Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cloned into retroviral vector MIGR1 (Addgene; plasmid no. 27490) 22 at XhoI and EcoRI sites.Ex vivo cell viability assay in primary EITL cells Primary EITL cells from patient 065T were subcutaneously injected into the NOD scid gamma (NSG) mouse (P1; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA), followed by further passaging of the subcutaneously formed tumor cells by subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection (P2). Eight-weekold female animals were used in each passage. P2 mouse presented with highly swollen peritoneum, and intestinal and peritoneal tumors. All samples, including peritoneal fluid cells from P2, were histologically characterized by a senior hematopathologist (SYT) and diagnosed EITL. Owing to the consistent phenotype between patient's primary tumor and P2 peritoneal fluid cells, we will refer to the latter as primary EITL cells henceforth. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of all somatic mutations identified in the original tumor (Supplementary Table 5) also in the primary cells. Animal experiments were in compliance with ethical regulations of the SingHealth Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Identification of somatic variants by WES To identify somatic mutations in EITL, we performed WES of four tumors with matching whole blood samples (Figure 1a). To maximize variant detection from a limited sample size, three different variant callers were applied-Genome Analysis Toolkit, 24 MuTect 25 and Strelka. 26 The mean depth of coverage was 126 × and on average 88% of targeted bases were covered by at least 20 reads (Supplementary Table 6). Sanger validation of 296 candidate variants showed a false-positive rate of 3.72%. EITL samples presented a high mutation burden with an average of 85 mutations per sample (range 59-137). A total of 340 nonsynonymous somatic mutations were identified in 313 genes. Seven of those genes also harbored silent somatic mutations (Supplementary Table 5). Among those were the calcium ionbinding gene multiple EGF-like-domains 6 (MEGF6), regulator of cell size proline-rich 16 (PRR16) and the giant muscle protein Titin (TTN), genes with functions in neuronal migration, axon guidance and chemoattraction-Reelin (RELN), Roundabout 1 (ROBO1) and Semaphorin 3 A (SEMA3A)-and with functions in the movement and transportation of cilia-Dynein 9 (DNAH9) and Intraflagellar Transport 140 (IFT140). In addition, mutations were identified in the histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) and two (putative) histone methyltransferases-additional sex comblike transcriptional regulator 3 (ASXL3) and SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2)-suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation may have a role in EITL.
Prevalence screening of GNAI2, JAK3, STAT5B and CREBBP The high frequency of STAT5B, JAK3 and GNAI2 mutations in a small discovery cohort of only four samples was intriguing, prompting us to further analyze the prevalence of these mutations in a larger series of EITL samples. Forty-two additional EITL tumors (1 snap frozen and 41 archival samples) were screened for GNAI2, JAK3 and STAT5B mutations using amplicon deep sequencing. A total of 57 identified mutations were covered by an average of 20 004 reads (range 104-175 515; Supplementary Table 8). As the amplicons covered only common mutation hotspots reported inCOSMIC v.72 and positions identified in the discovery cohort, it is likely that our results are lower-bound estimates of the true mutation frequency of these three genes. Figure 2 summarizes the results from both the discovery and prevalence cohorts. (Figure 2c). We identified two samples carrying two separate JAK3-activating mutations and a remarkable three activating mutations were identified in a third case indicating profound alteration of JAK3 function in these patients. Notably, none of these samples contained an activating STAT5B mutation (Figure 2a). Collectively, the JAK-STAT pathway was altered in 32/42 (76%) cases. It is remarkable that a large subset of tumors harbor co-occurring activating mutations in two members of the same pathway. A similar phenomenon was recently described for JAK1 and STAT3 in systemic ALK-negative anaplastic large T-cell lymphomas. 30 Moreover, these mutants were demonstrated to act in synergy to constitutively activate downstream STAT3 signaling. Further studies for mutated JAK3 and STAT5B are thus warranted and might shed light on EITL tumorigenesis. GNAI2 mutations were observed in 9/42 (21%) samples. Two major hotspots were identified-p.R179 and p.T182-both located in the GTP-binding domain (Figure 2d) and are known activating variants. 31-33 A single case was found to contain both mutations. Although exhibiting a lower mutation incidence compared with STAT5B and JAK3, it has been suggested that the lower frequencies for G protein α-subunits could be explained by mutations in receptors coupled to these G proteins. 34 On that note, both the GNAI2 wild-type discovery cohort samples harbored somatic mutations in GPCRs (Supplementary Table 5). It would be therefore interesting to analyze the mutational prevalence of GPCRs and other members of Gα i signaling in a larger cohort to determine the frequency at which this cascade is altered in EITL.
