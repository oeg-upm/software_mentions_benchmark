HRs with their 95% CIs were calculated on the basis of the association between LSD1 expression and the OS of cancer patients. The Ï‡ 2 test and the I 2 statistic were used to evaluate the heterogeneity among studies. 19 If the heterogeneity was significant between studies (I 2 .50% or P,0.10), the random effects model was used; otherwise, the fixed effects model was used. 20 Sensitivity analysis was also conducted by sequential omission of individual studies to evaluate stability of the results. Publication bias was estimated by Egger's linear regression test with a funnel plot. 21 The statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 12.0 software (Stata Corporation, Collage Station, TX, USA). All P-values were two-sided, and P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
