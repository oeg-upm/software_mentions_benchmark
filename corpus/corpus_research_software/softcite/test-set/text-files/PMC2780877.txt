High molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated using the PureGene kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and Hp was genotyped by an amplification method (26). Genotypes were assigned visually by comparison with controls of known genotype and in a random sample showed excellent agreement (97%) with an Eliza method (27). Statistical analysis. Nonnormally distributed variables were logarithmically transformed. Univariate associations were determined using the Student t test and 2 or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Cox proportional hazards models with backward elimination were constructed to assess the multivariable association between Hp genotype and the incidence of each outcome of interest adjusting for traditional risk factors (including eGFR and AER levels at study entry) and univariately significant variables. Survival time was defined as the time in years from study entry to either an incident event or censorship during the 18-year follow-up. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
