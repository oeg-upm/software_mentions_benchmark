The primary end point hypothesis used for sample-size estimation was that combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1 would increase the median PFS by 2 months (from 3 to 5 months) compared with gemcitabine monotherapy with a type I error probability of 5% (one-sided) and power of 80%. The required number of patients was 50 and a 5% dropout was accounted for in the sample-size calculation. The OS from randomisation was calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause or censored at the last follow-up. The PFS was calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of either disease progression or death or censored at the last follow-up. The OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and were compared between treatment arms using the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The ORRs were reported as best achieved response rates. Proportions between the arms were compared using the w 2 test or Fisher's test; quantitative variables were compared using Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon test. All analyses were conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. Two-sided P-values o0.05 were considered to be significant. The final analysis was based on follow-up information, which was collected until February 2011. JMP 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
