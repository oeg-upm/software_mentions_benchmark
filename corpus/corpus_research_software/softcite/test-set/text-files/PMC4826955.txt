3-T MRIs (0.6-mm isotropic voxels; 3D double-echo steadystate [DESS]; Siemens Trio) were acquired to generate 3-dimensional (3D) bone and meniscal models and to confirm bead placement and identify meniscal root insertions. Cartilage was manually segmented on MRI 3D DESS sequences and models were created using Mimics Software (Materialise). 28 Computed tomography (CT) images (0.6-mm slices; GE LightSpeed 16) were obtained to identifybone bead placement and to create 3D femur and tibia models.
DSX data were transferred to custom computerized software, and radiographic images were corrected for distortion and intensity gradient. As previously described, the positions of the implanted bone and meniscal beads were tracked and reconstructed into the 3D laboratory coordinate system in custom software with 0.1-mm precision Figure 3). 4,5,26 The CT scans were segmented and reconstructed into 3D specimen-specific femur and tibia models, and anatomic coordinate systems were manually established. 25 Knee kinematics (femoral and tibial bone positions) was determined by 3D locations of bone beads. Meniscal kinematics and deformation were determined by evaluating movement of meniscal beads relative to the tibia using custom MATLAB software (MathWorks Inc).
