Comparisons between variables were tested using the chi-square test or Student's t-test. We constructed a logistic regression model with obstructive lung disease as the dependent variable and age, sex, smoking history (more than 2 weeks), and TB lesions on CXR as independent variables. A forward selection method was used to exclude multi-colinearity of each variable. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with PASW 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
