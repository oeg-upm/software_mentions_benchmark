Many sRNAs act on gene expression by base pairing to target mRNAs and influencing either the stability of these targets or the rate of translation or both. To get a hint on possible targets of SorY we compared the transcriptomes of a control strain harbouring an empty vector (2.4.1pBBR) and of the overexpressing strain (2.4.1pBBRSorYi) after 10 min of 1 O 2 stress by microarray analysis (Fig. S1). From 3976 genes with a reliable A-value 17 protein coding genes showed a log 2 fold change of > 0.6 or < ¡0.6 between the 2 strains Table 1). Putative interaction of the mRNAs transcribed from these genes and SorY were predicted by the IntaRNA tool. 24 Table 1 shows the predicted parameters of genes with expression changes for which an energy value of less than ¡10 kcal/mol was calculated for a putative interaction. The effect of SorY on mRNA levels was confirmed by real time RT-PCR for RSP_2400, RSP_0097, sufC, and adhI Fig. 2A). The microarray data for flgF could not be confirmed and RSP_0432 was not tested, since no function for this gene is predicted. Real time RT-PCR also demonstrated that deletion of SorY had an opposite effect on the transcript levels of these mRNAs than overexpression of SorY (Fig. 2A).
Microarray analysis was performed as described before (Mank et al., 2012). Total RNA, obtained from aerobically grown cultures of strains 2.4.1pBBRSorYi and 2.4.1pBBR after 10 min of photooxidative stress, was chemically labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 (Kreatech; EA-022/EA-023), respectively. Multiarray analysis was performed with the Bio-conductor package Limma for R. On the basis of calculated MA plots, genes were considered reliable if the average signal intensity [A-value: 1/2 log2 (Cy3£Cy5)] was 12. To filter out potentially insignificant changes among genes that passed the reliability criterion, a cutoff value was applied; i.e., those genes were retained whose average expression value of 2.4.1pBBRSorYi (a) compared with the average value of the control treatment 2.4.1pBBR (b) was either a log2 Fold Change of 0.6 or a ¡0.6. Microarray data are deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo/; accession no. GSE63328).
Real Time RT-PCR Real Time RT-PCR was performed as described earlier 50 Measurements were done in a Bio-Rad CFX96 Real Time System and the corresponding program Bio-Rad CFX Manager was used for data analysis. After normalization relatively to the rpoZ gene, 53 which encodes the v-subunit of the RNA polymerase, relative mRNA levels were calculated according to. 54 Primers and corresponding efficiencies are listed in Table S4 and Table S5 respectively.
Northern blots were performed as described earlier. 9 Oligodeoxynucleotides used for end-labeling with [g-32 P]-ATP (Hartmann Analytic; SRP-301) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas; #EK0031) are listed in Table S4. A low stringency Church buffer was used for hybridization. 55 Membranes were washed in 5£ SCC buffer C 0.1 % SDS. After exposure on phosphoimaging screens (Bio-Rad), images were analyzed by the 1D-Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).
