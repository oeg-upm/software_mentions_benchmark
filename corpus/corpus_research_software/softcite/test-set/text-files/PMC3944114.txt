The model was developed using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) software program NONMEM VI Version 2 (Reagents of the University of California, San Francisco, CA) Standard and the first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (NONMEM coding provided in Supplementary Appendix). The change in the NONMEM objective functionvalue and goodness-of-fit plots were used to guide the model development. One-and two-compartment disposition models with first-order absorption and first-order elimination were evaluated based on the previous knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound from a single-dose study. 9 IIV was assessed on all structural model parameters, as was interoccasion variability (the occasion variable was derived based on the visit number: it was assumed that concentrations measured at different study visits represented distinct occasions). The pharmacokinetic parameters (k a , volumes, and clearances) were assumed to be log-normally distributed around the population mean, but the random effects to describe both IIV and interoccasion variability were assumed to be distributed with a mean of zero. The effects of covariates (age, BMI, creatinine clearance, sex, FEV 1 % predicted at baseline, and weight) on the pharmacokinetic model were investigated once an adequate structural and stochastic model had been finalized. Age was categorized into three groups: 6-11, 12-17, and â‰¥18 years. Each covariate was tested individually against the key structural model parameters k a , V d /F, and CL/F in a stepwise fashion (forward inclusion). After each step, the strongest covariate relationship was incorporated into the model, and the others sequentially and individually retested, until no further covariates could be added with statistical significance. The inclusion of a covariate term was considered statistically significant if it produced a difference of 3.84 (P = 0.05, given a single degree of freedom) in the NONMEM objective function value during the forward inclusion and if it produced an objective function value difference of 6.64 (P = 0.01, given a single degree of freedom) during the backward elimination. A combination of proportional and additive error models was used. The visual predictive check was used to provide an assessment of the model's ability to describe the data and the model's suitability for simulation. For the covariates identified after the stepwise process, 1,000 simulations were performed to evaluate their effect on the drug exposure at steady state using the following metrics: C max and C trough . The sensitivity of each metric to a given covariate was evaluated by simulation using different percentile values of the covariate distribution in the pharmacokinetic population, while keeping values of the other identified covariates in the model fixed at their median values in the pharmacokinetic population. These simulations were undertaken using the population parameter estimates from the final model and the IIV values of pharmacokinetic parameters, and they yielded the metrics of interest and their 95% predictive intervals. Further details of the modeling methods can be found in the Supplementary appendix.
