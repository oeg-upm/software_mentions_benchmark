Statistical Analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) were used as a measure of the association between the TNF-a 308G.A polymorphism and RHD risk. We evaluated the risk of the AA or GA genotype on RHD compared with the GG genotypes, and then calculated the ORs of GA/AA versus GG and AA versus GG/GA, using dominant and recessive genetic models of the A allele, respectively. Pooled estimates of the OR were obtained by calculating a weighted average of OR from eligible study. The betweenstudy heterogeneity I 2 was assessed with the Q-test 31. Heterogeneity was considered significant if the P , 0.05 among studies. The pooled OR was calculated using the fixed-effects model. Otherwise, the random-effects model was used. The HWE was assessed by Fisher's exact test with significance set at P , 0.05 level. The potential publication bias was constructed by a funnel plot. The funnel plot symmetry was evaluated by using Egger's linear regression test on the natural logarithm scale of the OR and significance was set at P , 0.05 level. All analyses were performed using theStata software (version 10.0 StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
