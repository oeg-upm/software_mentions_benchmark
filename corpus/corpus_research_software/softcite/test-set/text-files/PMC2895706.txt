We examined the associations between noodle consumption variables and socioeconomic characteristics such as gender, age, income, and ethnicity. All statistical analyses were adjusted for the sample weights and the complex sample design of NHANES by using SAS (release 9.13, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (release 10.1, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) [31]. All data sets were weighted to be nationally representative and standard errors were calculated by Taylor linearization variance estimation. Comparison of noodle consumption by gender was tested using t-tests, and Bonferroni multiple t-tests were used to analyze the differences in noodle intake by several ethnicity and income groups. The other ethnicgroups such as "White", "Black", "others" were statistically compared with Hispanics. The Chi-square test was used to compare noodle consumption with age, gender, income, and ethnicity (The result of Chi-square test were not showed in table).
