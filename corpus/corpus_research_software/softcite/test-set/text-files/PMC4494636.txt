Data gathered were encoded in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and data analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, version 21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Demographic data of the participants were summarized. The clinical characteristics differences among LUTS participants with PE versus without PE were statistically analyzed. The independent t test was used for analyzing continuous data such as age, IPSS sum, storage symptom score, and voiding symptom score. The ManneWhitney U test was applied to analyze ordinal data with a Likert scale 1e5 of individual IPSS symptom domains, prostate size range of 20e60 g, and educational attainment (Table 1) from primary school to doctorate degree. The Chisquare test was done to analyze nominal data such as the presence or absence of comorbidity (hypertension and diabetes mellitus) and marital status. The statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
