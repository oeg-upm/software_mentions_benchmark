After 8 days of culture, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol for 15 min and observed by microscopy after Congo Red (CR) staining, following a modified protocol [12, 13] to allow a perfect distinction between collagen and amyloid. Samples were incubated in 1% CR for 40 min, washed in water, incubated for 10 s in 1 ml of 1% sodium hydroxide in 100 ml of 50% ethanol, incubated for 30 s in Mayer's haematoxylin, sequentially washed in 50%, 75% and 95% ethanol, mounted and observed under a polarized light microscope (Zeiss Axio Lab.A1, Arese, Milano, Italy). Moreover, CR birefringence was quantified in the polarized images by Photoshop CSII software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA). Three 20Ã‚ fields were chosen as to best reflect the overall CR birefringence of cells contained on the entire slide. Total black area was automatically selected. Subsequently the selection was inverted to evidence birefringence areas. The number of birefringence pixels was extrapolated and normalized with the total cell number in each field. Finally, based on the ratio birefringent pixels/cells, the percentage of birefringence inhibition of each antioxidant in HGA-treated cells was evaluated. We also evaluated the birefringence generated by the cell exposition to each antioxidant compound without HGA treatment.
Human chondrocytes were incubated with a fluorescent fatty acid probe (50 mM), 4,4-difluoro-5-(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoic acid (C11-BODIPY 581/591 , Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at 37 C for 30 min. C11-BODIPY 581/591 is able to intercalate in the phospholipids bilayer and LPO was localized by observing the changes in C11BODIPY 581/591 fluorescence. The intact probe fluoresces red when it is intercalated into the membrane ( excitation = 590 nm and emission = 635 nm) and shifts to green ( excitation = 485 nm and emission = 535 nm) after oxidative radicals attack. Excess probe was removed by washing the cells twice with PBS. After incubation with the probe, samples were treated with HGA, Nac + Asc or Nac + Asc + HGA at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 2 h. The staining was examined by Leitz Aristoplan microscope fluorescence (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Representative images were taken in specific areas of samples using Leica Q Fluoro Standard, Leica Chantal software. The percentage of cells showing a high green fluorescence was calculated against the total number of cells in each sample.
