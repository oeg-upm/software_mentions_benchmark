The arrays were analyzed using an Agilent scanner with associated software. Gene expression levels were calculated with Feature Extraction v10.7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies).Relative signal intensities for each gene were generated using the Robust Multi-Array Average algorithm. The data were processed based on quantile normalization method using the GeneSpring GX 11.5.1 (Agilent Technologies). This normalization method aims to make the distribution of intensities for each array in a set of arrays the same. The normalized, and log transformed intensity values were then analyzed using GeneSpring GX 11.5.1 (Agilent Technologies). Fold change filters included the requirement that the genes be present in at least 200% of controls for up-regulated genes and lower than 50% of controls for down-regulated genes.
