Ten caregivers with different professional backgrounds and 12 patients from primary care and outpatient clinics were purposively selected and participated in semistructuredinterviews. All interviews were conducted by the same researcher using a topic list developed according to the principles of Kvale. 49 Recordings were transcribed verbatim by an independent transcription service and subsequently compared with the audio recordings for completeness and accuracy. Both content and thematic analyses were used based on the framework approach. 50 Interviews were coded by two separately working researchers with the use of the data analysis software of Dedoose, a web-based program for mixed methods research. The top 9 most-coded key concepts (%) from both the patients and the HCPs were collected and compared.
