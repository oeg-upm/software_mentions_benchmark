Statistical analyses were performed using PRISM (GraphPad Software). Overall ANOVA was followed by planned pairwise comparisons between the relevant groups with a Tukey honestly significant difference HSD post hoc test. Unless stated otherwise, all experiments are n R 8.
To visualize native GFP or mRFP, we collected adult flies 4-6 days after eclosion and brains were dissected in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (1.86 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 8.41 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 175 mM NaCl) and fixed for an additional 60 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed 3 3 10 min with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT) and 2 3 10 min in PBS before mounting in Vectashield (Vector Labs). Imaging was performed on Leica TCS SP5 X. The resolution of the image stack was 1,024 3 1,024 with 0.5 mm step size and a frame average of 4. Images were processed in AMIRA 5.3 (Mercury Systems). The immunostaining against tyrosine hydroxylase and GFP was performed as described previously in Burke et al. (2012).
Objective Microscope (Sutter) with a Zeiss 203, 1.0 NA W-Plan-Apochromat objective. Emitted photons were separated from excitation light by a series of dichromatic mirrors and dielectric and colored glass filters and detected by GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu Photonics H10770PA-40 SEL). Photomultiplier currents were amplified (Laser Components HCA-4M-500K-C) and passed through a custom-designed integrator circuit to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The microscope was controlled through MPScope 2.0 (Nguyen et al., 2006) via a PCI-6110 DAQ board (National Instruments). Odor stimuli were delivered by switching mass-flow-controlled carrier and stimulus streams (CMOSense Performance Line, Sensirion) via software-controlled solenoid valves (The Lee Company). Flow rates at the exit port of the odor tube were 0.5 l/min. Images were converted to Analyze format and motion corrected by maximizing the pixel-by-pixel correlation between each frame and a reference frame. DF/F traces were calculated in ImageJ using manually drawn regions of interest (ROIs) for the background and brain structure of interest. Activity maps were generated in MATLAB from Gaussian-smoothed, backgroundsubtracted images. A baseline fluorescence image was calculated as the average over a 10 s prestimulus interval. Minor z direction movement was ignored by correlating each frame to the baseline fluorescence and discarding it if the correlation fell below a threshold value. This threshold value was manually selected for each brain by noting the constant high correlation value when the brain was stationary and sudden drops in correlation when the brain moved. For each pixel, the difference between mean intensity during the stimulus and the mean baseline fluorescence (DF) was calculated. The DF during the presentation of a dummy stimulus (no odor) was subtracted to control for mechanical artifacts from the odor delivery system. If DF was less than two times the SD of the intensity of that pixel during the prestimulus interval, that pixel was considered unresponsive.
