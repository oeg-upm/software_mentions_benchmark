Detector resolution. The detector determines the locations of the anti-atom annihilations by triangulation of the pion tracks produced by each annihilation. This process was extensively studied using the GEANT 3 code 48 , and a probability density function for the azimuthal resolution error was determined 37. This error was incorporated into the simulation results by adding random angular offsets consistent with this probability density function to each of the simulated annihilation angular locations.
