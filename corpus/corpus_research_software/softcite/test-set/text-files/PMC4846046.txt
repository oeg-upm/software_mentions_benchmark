Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Categorical variables were first summarized as absolute and relative frequencies, while continuous variables were described as mean values and standard deviations (n=70). The association between exposure and outcome variables (a diagnosis of sarcopenia according to EWGSOP and Baumgartner criteria) was evaluated using chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated. Exposure variables were categorized at the median, in the case of height and weight, or as described in the previous section.
