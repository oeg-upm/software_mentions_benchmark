There are currently two validated indexes available for assessing the disease location and severity of small bowel CD with CE Table 4). The Lewis score evaluates three small bowel segments for the parameters villous appearance, ulcers and stenosis [61]. The Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index. (CECDAI) evaluates the proximal and distal small bowel for the parameters inflammatory lesions, disease extension and stenosis [62]. A software application for calculation of the Lewis score has been incorporated into the RAPID Reader platform for Pillcam SB. The following cutoffs have been proposed: <135, normal small bowel or clinically insignificant inflammation; 135-79, mild disease activity; and >790, moderate to severe disease [61]. The CECDAI is simpler to calculate, but cutoffs for endoscopic remission and different disease severities have not been properly established. However, there is a good correlation between the two indexes (r=0.63, P<0.0001), and in a retrospective and unblinded single reader analysis, CECDAI levels of 3.8 and 5.8 corresponded to Lewis scores of 135 and 790, respectively [40,63].
Given Imaging's RAPID Reader enables alterations of the viewing mode from single to dual or quad view, and the frame rate can be adjusted from 5 to 40 frames per second (fr/sec). GÃ¼nther et al compared single view at a speed of 10 fr/sec with quad view at 20 fr/sec [78]. The mean reading time was reduced from 22 down to 12 min, and detection rates of angioectasias, erosions, ulcers, and polyps were significantly lower with quad view. However, in patients with suspected or known CD, overlooked lesions did not change the result of the examination. Recently, Nakamura et al compared single view, dual view and quad view at different frame rates, using a small bowel video sequence with 60 pathological images of small bowel angioectasias [79]. Increasing the frame rate from 10 to 15, 25 and 40 fr/sec resulted in a 33%, 60%, and 72% reduction in playing time, respectively, but at the expense of a drop in the number of lesions detected. Altering the viewing mode had no effect on the reading time for any given frame rate, but the detection rate was significantly higher with dual and quad view compared to single view. The authors conclude that the optimal combination for a high detection rate is 10 fr/sec using dual or quad view.
Another way to decrease reading times is by reducing the number of images presented to the capsule endoscopist. The quick view function provided by Given Imaging's RAPID Reader filters the number of images shown. With a sampling rate of 10% (default setting), 10% of images from the original videos is shown. Images are filtered according to a specific algorithm developed by the manufacturer, and sampling rates between 2% and 80% can be chosen. Shiotani et al examined how different sampling rates affect the detection rates of quick view CE [80]. A variety of preselected lesions were included in the study. With sampling rates of 5%, 15%, 25% and 35%, 61%, 74%, 93% and 98% of lesions were detected. With a 25% sampling rate, only 7% of lesions were missed, and the reading time was reduced by approximately 50%. This setting was considered a proper tradeoff between reading times and detection rates. Koulaouzidis et al studied 81 patients with suspected or known CD [81]. A total of 155 and 71 ulcerations were detected with CE and quick view CE, respectively, with a 35% sampling rate, corresponding to a miss rate of 54%. In patients with suspected or known CD, quick view CE was false negative (i.e. no or non-specific lesions or <3 ulcerations) in 1 (7%) and 8 (10%) patients, respectively. In a study by our group, including 40 patients with suspected CD, standard view CE visualized 171 small bowel ulcerations, compared to 102 lesions detected with quick view CE (miss rate 40%, P=0.02) [82]. However, with ileocolonoscopy and standard view CE as gold standard, quick view CE diagnosed 15 of 16 patients with small bowel CD, corresponding to a sensitivity of 94%, while 39 out of 40 patients were classified correctly overall (diagnostic accuracy 98%). Reading times varied from 5-18 min (median 10).
