However, to ensure sufficient comparability, we restricted the latter to subregions with maximally two LNMs. For these LNMs we determined longitudinal and short diameters of LNM and tumor deposits. We then modeled the detection of the LNM by PET as a function of the diameter using a logistic regression model in STATA Â® version 14.1, which allows estimating thresholds corresponding to 50% and 90% detection rates. The remaining statistics were obtained with SPSS v19 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA). Table 1. Median PSA at salvage-LND was 1.7 ng/ml (IQR 0.8 -2.9 ng/ml). Overall 965 LN have been resected, median 33.0 (IQR 25.5 -41.5) were removed per patient, whereof median 1.0 (IQR 1 -6.5) per patient turned out to be metastases (Table 1). 87/110 (79%) LNM were removed from true-positive subregions, 23/110 (21%) LNM originated from false-negative subregions.
