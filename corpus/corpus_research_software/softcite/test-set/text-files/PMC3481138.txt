E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a and is upregulated in AML. We previously showed that miR-26a negatively regulates cell proliferation and stimulates myeloid differentiation of AML cells. 17 Notably, miR-26a negatively regulates G 1 /S transition in different tumors and this has been attributed, at least in part, to the direct regulation of EZH2 by miR-26a. 16,17,19,21 However, we showed that EZH2 is not a direct target of miR-26a in AML cells. 17 Thus, we decided to investigate novel relevant targets for miR-26a function in AML. Between the putative targets of miR-26a, we noticed the E2F7 transcription factor (data from TargetScan (www.targetscan.org) and Pictar (pictar.mdc-berlin.de)), an important regulator of the G 1 /S-phase transition. 23 The 3'-untranslated region (3 0 -UTR) of E2F7 contained two highly conserved putative binding sites for miR-26a (Figure 1a). To show the direct targeting of E2F7 by miR-26a, we constructed luciferase reporters containing the wild type (WT) 3 0 -UTR of E2F7 (WT), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site I (Mut1), the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at the miR-26a binding site II (Mut2) or the E2F7 3 0 -UTR mutated at both miR-26a binding sites (Mut1-2). Luciferase reporters were individually co-transfected in HeLa cells with a plasmid expressing miR-26a or control (Figure 1b). The expression of WT reporter was significantly decreased by miR-26a compared with control. Reporter Mut1 behaved similarly to WT, while deletion of Mut2 partially relieved translational repression. On the other hand, expression of the reporter construct mutated at both miR-26a binding sites of E2F7 3 0 -UTR (Mut1-2) was not sensitive to miR-26a translational repression. This may be explained by the fact that the binding of miR-26a on site II increases the accessibility to site I or, alternatively, binding of one repressive complex on site II may serve as scaffold for attracting cofactors necessary for repression on site I. These results demonstrated that miR-26a regulated E2F7 expression through direct binding of the 3 0 -UTR. To further demonstrate that miR-26a represses E2F7 expression in AML, U937 cells were infected with a lentivirus containing an miR-26a expression cassette (Lenti-26a) or control (Mock inf.). Enforced expression by lentiviral transduction significantly increased miR-26a levels with a concomitant decrease in E2F7 protein levels (Figure 2a). Similar results were obtained with the HL-60 cell line (Supplementary Figure 1). Altogether, these data indicated that E2F7 is a direct target of miR-26a in AML.
RNA interference and miR-26a overexpression. E2F7 knockdown was obtained by Mission Lentiviral shRNA clones targeting E2F7 TRCN0000017455 and TRCN000017453 (Sigma-Aldrich). Mission Lentiviral Non-Targeting shRNA clone SHC002 (Sigma-Aldrich) was utilized as control.The miR-26a target E2F7 counteracts monocytic differentiation B Salvatori et al Lentiviral particles were prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. Lentiviral vectors for miR-26a expression and control were described previously. 17 Infection of AML cell lines was performed as described previously. 40 Cell proliferation and differentiation. For cell cycle analysis, 2 Ã‚ 10 5 cells were resuspended in PBS/50% FCS, fixed in 70% ethanol for 24 h, incubated with 50 Ag/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 U/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich), and analyzed after 3 h (10 000 events) using an Epics XL Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Morphology was evaluated after 7 days from lentiviral transduction in conventional light-field microscopy of Wright-Giemsa-stained cytospins. Differentiation was assessed by direct immunofluorescence staining of cells using an allophycocyanin anti-human CD11b (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), PerCP anti-human CD14 (Becton Dickinson) and PE-IgG1 isotype control (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) as described previously. 17 A minimum of 10 000 events were collected for each sample with flow cytometer (CyAN ADP; Dako Italia S.p.a., Milan, Italy) by using the Summit 4.3 software (Beckman Coulter) for data acquisition and analysis.RNA extraction and analysis. Total RNA was prepared using Qiazol reagent and miRNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Hsa-miR-26a analysis by real-time PCR was performed using miRScript System (Qiagen) and E2F7 analysis was performed with QuantiTect Primer Assay QT00059115 (Qiagen). Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA (Qiagen). P-values between primary AML samples and monocytes data were obtained with t-test. cDNAs for p21, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 analysis were generated with miRScript RT Kit (Qiagen). Oligonucleotides are described in the primers list (shown below). M-CSF, M-CSFr and MafB were detected with TaqMan oligonucleotides Hs00166144_m1, Hs00234622_m1 and Hs00534343_s1, respectively, and normalized by the amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) Hs99999905_m1 (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Italia, Monza MB, Italy). MiR-17 and miR-20a were detected with TaqMan microRNA assay TM-393 and TM-580 (Applied Biosystems), respectively. Delta-delta Ct values were normalized with those obtained from the amplification of the endogenous U6 snRNA, TaqMan probe TM-1093 (Applied Biosystems). All reactions were performed in triplicate.
