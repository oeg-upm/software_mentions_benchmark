The methods are applied to the methylome of a single cell type, a root epidermis (Wer+) cell from A. thaliana Col-0. There are a total of 452 partially methylated regions as defined in Section 3.1. The total genomic length of the regions is 84 397 bp, covering 9980 methylcytosines. The 22926 reads are aligned to these regions. Once the methylation levels of the two alleles and the membership of all reads are predicted by the models, the results are subject to four methods for classification as mentioned in Sections 3.3 and 3.4. Recall that the SVM model is trained on the synthetic methylome made up of two Arabidopsis root methylomes, Wer+ being one of them. Table 4 shows the number of PMRs predicted to be allelespecific by each method and the intersection is taken so as to obtain the most conservative predictions. The first two rows of the table reflect the intersections taken between the d h class and all other criteria, and d m class and other criteria, respectively, totaling 34 regions. Table 5 lists the details and annotations for group (1), and Table 6 for group (2). Based on the predicted methylation levels, both groups are highly allele-specific. While one of the two alleles has nearly no methylation, in the first group of 18 regions, the other allele is in general highly methylated; and in the second group of 16 regions, the methylated allele is more partially methylated. An example from each group is shown in Figure 2. If the criteria for ASM are relaxed a bit by removing the rather stringent filter lmr, many more regions [the last row (3) in Table 4] are admittedi167 Table 6. Predicted ASM regions, group (2) in Table 4 chfor further examination. An example from this group is shown in Figure 3. Table 7 summarizes the TAIR
          9 annotations (TAIR, 2009) for all three groups of a total of 226 predicated ASM regions. Many regions overlap with natural transposons as expected; the last row in the table reports the number of regions that have no other annotation than transposon. For the protein coding genes, the gene ontology annotations are summarized in Table 8. One region from group (3), on forward strand of chromosome 1: 11267775 -11268327, is on the antisense of an exon of protein coding gene AT3G29360, an imprinted gene in A. thaliana seed reported by McKeown et al. (2011). The region has 26 methylcytosines.
