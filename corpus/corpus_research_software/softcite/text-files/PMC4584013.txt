cRNA targets were hybridized on high-density oligonucleotide gene chips (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 and GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Arrays) according to the Affymetrix Eukaryotic Target Hybridization manual. The gene chips were washed and stained using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and Genechip Operating Software and scanned by means of an Affymetrix GeneArray scanner.
To understand the biological meaning behind the list of DE genes, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG) pathways analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) from DAVID website (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) v 6.7 (http:// david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) were used. Only GO and pathways with Pvalue b 0.05 (Benjamin-Hochberg corrected) and with 5 or more genes were analyzed and discussed. In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used. Only pathways and functions with P b 0.05 (Fisher's exact test right-tailed) were analyzed and discussed.
