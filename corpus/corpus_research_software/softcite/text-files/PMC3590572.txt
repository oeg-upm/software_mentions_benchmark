• C, by incubating 20 nM CL14/CP25 and an excess of Top1 with DMSO, as no-drug control, or 50 μM Et-KuQ, or preincubating the enzyme and the compound for 10 min before adding the suicide substrate [22]. At various time points 5 μl aliquots were removed and the reaction stopped with 0.5 % (w/v) SDS. After ethanol precipitation samples were resuspended in 5 μl of 1 mg/ml trypsin to degrade the protein and were analysed by denaturing 7 M urea/20 % (w/v) PAGE in 48 mM Tris, 45.5 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA. However, a short trypsinresistant peptide is always left, explaining why the Cl1 migrates slower than the Cl14 oligonucleotide [23]. The percentage of cleavage, determined by PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software, was calculated in each lane as the ratio between the amount of cleavage product and the total amount of radioactivity. The percentage of cleavage product, corresponding to the plateau observed for the experiment carried out with the substrate and the enzyme alone, was then considered as 100 % of cleavage product and all the other measurements were normalized to this value.
• C for 60 min. Samples were analysed by denaturing 7 M urea/20 % (w/v) PAGE in 48 mM Tris, 45.5 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA. The religation percentage, determined by ImageQuant software, was plotted as a function of time and normalized to the plateau value.• C in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM Na 2 EDTA, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mg/ml acetylated BSA and 150 mM KCl and were stopped at two different times: 1 and 2 min, by adding 0.5 % (w/v) SDS, precipitating with ethanol and digesting with trypsin [25]. Products were resolved in 20 % (w/v) PAGE/7 M urea gel and quantified using ImageQuant software. The values were calculated by the ratio between the cleavage amount and the total radioactivity of each lane, subtracting the control background.
The deprotonated Et-KuQ molecular geometry in the gas phase was obtained at the B3LYP/6-31 + G(d,p) level of theory using GAMESS-US-2011 ed. [26]. The molecular geometry of the Top1 non-covalent binary complex was obtained by modelling the 1A36 PDB entry; after removing the DNA, the same structure was used to obtain a model of the Top1 enzyme in the absence of DNA. The 1T8I PDB entry was used to obtain a model for the ternary complex. The MGLTools 1.5.6 rc1 was used to convert the PDB into PDBQT format, to calculate the GasteigerMarsilii charges and produce the input file. Grid was calculated using an in-house modified version of AutoGrid 4.2.2.1 using a 256×256×256 grid with step of 0.5Å (1Å = 0.1 nm) enclosing the whole Top1. 250 runs of docking were generated using the standard GA algorithm with AutoDock 4.2.2.1 [27] for Et-KuQ on each of the three systems. The complexes were clusterized on the basis of their RMSD (root-mean-square deviation), using a cut-off value of 2Å. Figures 6-8 were generated with UCSF Chimera 1.9 (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/ chimera).
