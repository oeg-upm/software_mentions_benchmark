Data were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed using the SPSS 10.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Differences between groups were assessed by Student's t-test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.Brain sections were stained with H&E and the infarcted area was revealed with pale-staining, surrounded by curvilinear border (left). Different sizes of infarct areas were generated by different irradiation level, C-4, C-5 and C-6 (right). On day 30 after ischemia, the volume of infarction in C-6 was significantly greater than other groups. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of independent experiments performed (n = 5; *P < 0.05).
