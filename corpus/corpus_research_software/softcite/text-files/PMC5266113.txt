The statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For the continuous variables, the results are expressed as the medians and interquartile ranges or with Tukey box-and-whisker plots. The Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to assess the significance of intergroup variability. Twotailed Mann-Whitney U tests were used for between group comparisons. The differences in proportions between groups were evaluated with χ 2 tests. Bonferroni corrections were applied to adjust for multiple comparisons (i.e., α=0.05/3=0.016). Spearman tests were used to examine the correlations. The level of significance was set at P<0.05.
