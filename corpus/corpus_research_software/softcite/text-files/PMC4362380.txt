Flow cytometer. Cells were resuspended by vigorous mixing using a 25 ml serological pipette (BD Biosciences). Then 1 ml of resuspended cells was transferred into a 5 ml polystyrene tube (BD Biosciences, Durham, NC), washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma Aldrich), spun for 5 minutes at 400g, and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellet was subsequently resuspended in 100 µl phosphate-buffered saline, 50 µl of CountBright absolute counting beads (Life Technologies Corporation) was added and each tube was vortexed briefly before acquiring the samples. Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) was used to acquire the data by gating on the beads. Cells were quantified using Kaluza analysis software (Beckman Coulter), and the formula provided by the bead manufacturer was used to calculate the absolute number of cells (Life Technologies Corporation).
