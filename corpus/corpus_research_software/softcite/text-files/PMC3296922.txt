Three consecutive 24-hour food recalls (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) were obtained from each subject by trained interviewers using food models. Retinol intakes were estimated using a CAN-pro 3.0 nutritional analysis program developed by the Korean Nutrition Society [18]. Carotenoid intakes (α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene) were measured by the values of the book, "Phytonutrient Contents in Vegetable/Fruits/Legumes," reporting carotenoid contents in plant foods [19], the values of carotenoids in some Korean foods [20,21], and the carotenoid values in the United States Department of Agriculture Food database [22]. Dietary vitamin A intakes in this study were calculated with retinol and provitamin A carotenoid intakes as both μg RE and as μg RAE (μg RE = μg retinol + μg β-carotene/6 + μg α-carotene/12 + μg β-cryptoxanthin/ 12, μg RAE = μg retinol + μg β-carotene/12 + μg α-carotene/24 + μg β-cryptoxanthin/24).
Data were analyzed by age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49 and 50-59 years) using SAS version 9.1.3 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The differences among age groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with the Least Significant Difference post-hoc test [23]. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between intakes and plasma concentrations of retinol and carotenoids. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Values are reported as means ± standard deviations. Table 1 shows anthropometric measurements of the subjects by age group. The mean weight, height, and BMI (mean ± SD) 20The daily retinol intakes of subjects in the 50's age group were significantly lower than those in their 20's and 30's. The retinol intakes per 1,000 kcal in the 50's age group (44.63 μg/1,000 kcal) were also significantly lower than those in their 20's and 30's (96.02 and 120.04 μg/1,000 kcal, respectively) (data not shown). However, lycopene intakes of subjects in their 50's were significantly higher than those in their 20's (P < 0.05). Dietary intakes of β-carotene and lutein/zeaxanthin tended to increase by age. The daily vitamin A intakes were 887.77 ± 401.35 μg RE or 531.84 ± 226.42 μg RAE. There was no significant difference observed in vitamin A intakes among the age groups.
