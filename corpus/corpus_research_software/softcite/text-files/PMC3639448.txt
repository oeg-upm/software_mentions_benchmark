In an initial run of our PERL pipeline for the three search strategies described above, we identified genome-wide a total of 260 preliminary informative Alu and Alu-like loci, 200 preliminary LINE loci, and 120 preliminary LTR loci. All of these loci were then subjected to careful manual inspections of the insertion sites, looking for only those with exact orthologous insertions according to the criteria explained below. Only 19 Alu-like, 22 LINE, and 63 LTR loci with retroposed elements present in both tarsier 1 human fulfilled these criteria Supplementary Information; Figure 2); none were found with shared elements in either strepsirrhines 1 human or tarsier 1 strepsirrhines. The diagnostic elements active at the time of thewith 104 conflict-free phylogenetic informative markers for haplorrhine the probability of supporting the wrong tree topology is less than 7.2 3 10 250 . Thus, tarsiers are clearly the closest relatives of higher primates.
