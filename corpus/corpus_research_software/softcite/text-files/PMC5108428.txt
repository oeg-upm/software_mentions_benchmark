Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for evacetrapib were calculated by using standard noncompartmental methods of analysis using WinNonlin software, v.6.2.1 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA). The primary parameters for analysis were area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last time point with a measurable concentration (AUC 0-tlast ); AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞ ); maximum observed drug concentration (C max ); and the time to reach maximum concentration (T max ). The AUC was calculated by using a combination of the linear and logarithmic trapezoidal methods (linear-log trapezoidal rule). The linear trapezoidal method was applied up to T max , and then the logarithmic trapezoidal method was used after T max . The minimum requirement for the calculation of AUC was the inclusion of at least three consecutive plasma concentrations above the lower level of quantitation, with at least one of these concentrations following C max . The C max and T max were reported from visual inspection of the concentration versus time curve. The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ), apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase were also estimated. The t 1/2 was calculated, when appropriate, based on the apparent terminal log-linear portion of the concentration-time curve. The start of the terminal elimination phase for each subject was determined by visual inspection and generally was the first point at which there was no systematic deviation from the log-linear decline in plasma concentrations. The t 1/2 was estimated only when at least three concentrations were available for its calculation in the terminal phase. Descriptive statistics, including geometric mean and coefficient of variation (CV), were calculated.
The effects of gastric pH on evacetrapib AUC 0-∞ and C max were analyzed by using a mixed-effects analysis of variance model. Parameters were log-transformed prior to analysis. The model included a fixed effect for treatment (evacetrapib alone or evacetrapib + omeprazole) and a random effect for subject. The ratios of geometric least-squares (LS) means for evacetrapib + omeprazole (test treatment) compared with evacetrapib alone (reference treatment) were calculated along with the 90% CIs of the ratios. The ratios of geometric LS means were considered statistically significant if the 90% CIs did not contain 1. The T max for evacetrapib was analyzed by using SAS procedure PROC UNI- VARIATE software. The median of differences and~90% CI for the median of differences between evacetrapib + omeprazole and evacetrapib alone were calculated. The difference in T max was considered statistically significant if the 90% CI did not contain zero.
