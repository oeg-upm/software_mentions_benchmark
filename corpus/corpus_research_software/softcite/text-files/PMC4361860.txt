To retrieve subjects from the SEER database, the following criteria were entered in the selection statement of SEER*stat software: histologically confirmed RCC, excluding cancers diagnosed at autopsy or by death certificate only, RCC recorded as a first primary malignancy, follow-up months more than 0, diagnosed time-frame from 1998 to 2010, and ages 18-90. Of the 125,793 listed cases, we further excluded patients with a tumor size equal to 0 or larger than 30 cm (n 5 9558) and SEER historic stage unknown (n 5 1696). The study cohort consisted of 114,539 patients with RCC.
