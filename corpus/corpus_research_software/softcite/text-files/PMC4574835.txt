The population PK models were developed via a nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach using the first order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCEI) of NONMEM software (version VII Level 1.2) [10]. Structural model selection was driven by the data and was based on evaluation of goodness-of-fit plots (observed vs. predicted concentrations, weighted residuals vs. predicted values or time, histograms of individual random effects etc.), successful convergence, plausibility and precision of parameter estimates and the minimum objective function value (OFV).
A prediction corrected visual predictive check [13] (PC-VPC) was performed for the final PK model. Five hundred data sets were simulated using the final model parameters, covariates, sampling times and dosing histories. Both the observed and the model predicted individual concentration values were normalized by the population prediction of the same time point. Non-parametric bootstrap analysis was also performed by generating 1000 data sets through random sampling with replacement from the original data using the individual as the sampling unit. No stratification was implemented during the random sampling. Population parameters of the final model for each data set were estimated using NONMEM and empirical 95% CIs were constructed.
