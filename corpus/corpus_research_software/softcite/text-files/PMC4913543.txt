Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was estimated by the goodnessof-fit test based on the chi-square test in the control group of each study. 36 Pooled analysis was conducted to estimate the strength of the association between CD44 rs13347 CT polymorphism and cancer risk, using an OR with a corresponding 95% CI. The pooled ORs were calculated by comparisons with a codominant model (CT vs CC and TT vs CC), a dominant model (TT + CT vs CC), and a recessive model (TT vs CC + CT). The values of the pooled ORs were tested by the Z-test. 37 Stratified analyses were further performed based on country (People's Republic of China or India), specific cancer types (nasopharyngeal cancer, gallbladder cancer, or breast cancer), source of controls OncoTargets and Therapy 2016:9 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress 3495 cD44 rs13347 cT polymorphism and cancer risk (hospital based or population based), and genotyping method (TaqMan or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight). Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated by the chi-square-based Q-test. 38 Pooled ORs were calculated using a fixed (Mantel-Haenszel method 39) or a random (DerSimonian-Laird method 40) effective model, according to the absence (P0.10 and I 2 50%) or presence (P0.10 or I 2 50%) of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were performed by omitting one study each time to evaluate the stability of the results. The potential publication bias of the included studies was assessed by Begg's funnel plots graphically and Egger's test quantitatively. 41 All the statistical calculations were carried out with Stata/ SE software Version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), using two-sided P-values, and P0.05 was considered to be significant.
