Continuous variables followed a normal distribution is expressed as mean Â± SD. For comparisons of continuous variables between both groups the Student t test for unpaired observations was used. We used the chi-square test to compare categoric variables between groups unless expected values were less than 5, in which case we used the Fisher exact test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the association between the composite endpoint and coronary collateral circulation. All results were analyzed by using a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Data analyses were performed by using the statistical software SPSS 11.0 from SPSS Inc. (USA).
