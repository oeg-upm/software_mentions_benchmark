All data collected for the activities of catalase, GPx, and SOD, TRA, the contents of TBARS, carbonyl, and nonheme iron, and CIE a* value were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance using the general linear model procedure of SPSS (2011) program. As fixed factors, the effects of packaging system (VACP, MOMAP, VSP-MOMAP, HOMAP, and VSP-HOMAP), storage time (d 1, 7, and 14 or d 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14), and their interaction (packaging system√óstorage time) on all variables were evaluated in our study. Duncan's multiple range test was carried out to compare significant (p<0.05) differences among mean values of variables in packaging systems within each storage time or in storage times within each packaging system, when significances of two main factors were presented.
