The experiment took place in a quiet temperature-controlled laboratory, and the ambient temperature was kept 26°C. In the experiment, the subjects lay in the supine position on a single bed quietly throughout the experimental procedure. The procedure of the CPT experiment lasted 13 minutes and included 3 phases (showed in Fig. 1): the baseline phase (5 minutes), the cold stimulus phase (3 minutes), and the recovery phase (5 minutes). In the cold stimulus phase, the subject immersed his/her left hand to the wrist into a mixture of ice and water (4°C) for 3 minutes. During the entire experimental procedure, cardiovascular signals were collected by Finometer MIDI (Model II, Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands); and the cardiovascular signals mainly included SBP, DBP, stoke volume, and electrocardiograph (ECG). Then these cardiovascular signals were stored in a personal computer by the BeatScope Easy software (Finapres Medical Systems B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The BP was measured by the volume-clamp method in the Finometer MIDI [25] ; in the volume-clamp method, a cuff wrapped around the finger to keep the arterial diameter constant, and the changes in the arterial diameter were detected by photo-plethysmography [25] ; physiocal algorithm was used to maintain the correct arterial diameter. [26] The stroke volume was measured by Modelflow method [25] ; the Modelflow method was utilized to calculate an aortic flow waveform from the finger pressure by simulating a non-linear three-element model of aortic input impedance. [25] 2.3. TAC assessment There was no "gold standard" to assess the TAC. Chemla et al [13] proposed the ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure (SV/PP) to measure TAC. The pulse pressure represented the difference between SBP and DBP readings. The SV/PP had been proven reliable to assess the TAC. [11] Therefore, we used SV/PP to estimate TAC in this study.
