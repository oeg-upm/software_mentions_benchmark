On two occasions, computed tomography (CT) was performed to evaluate the spread of lidocaine: first, on the day of catheterization (n = 6) and again at 5th week, immediately before the catheter was removed (n = 5). We injected a contrast medium, iohexol (1.5 mL), via the epidural catheter under general anaesthesia. The spread of contrast medium was determined by counting the number of vertebral body units through a 16-detector low CT scanner (aquilion; toshiba medical systems, Nasu, Japan) (13). The contrast medium on CT images was colored blue by imageediting software (Ziostation; Ziosoft, Tokyo, Japan).
