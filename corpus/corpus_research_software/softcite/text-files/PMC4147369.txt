Statistical analysis. The data were presented as mean 6 s.e.m., where appropriate. The neuron density was derived from MAP2-positive cells that were counted in fluorescent images and converted to the number of neurons per mm 2, and the soma area of individual MAP2-positive cells was estimated, using ImageJ. The percentage of excitatory and inhibitory neurons was obtained by visually identifying the number of MAP2-positive and vGLUT1-positive neurons or MAP2-positive and GAD67-positive neurons, and divided by the number of MAP2-positive neurons examined. The peak Ba 21 currents were normalized to the cell membrane capacitance and presented as current density. To determine the basal Ca 21 level and cytosolic Ca 21 oscillations, cells with the basal F340/F380 value within the average 6 2 3 standard deviation were included in analysis, and a Ca 21 spike was defined with its amplitude being .1.2 times of the basal level. The number of Ca 21 oscillation per minute and the changes in F340/F380 were used to calculate the frequency and amplitude. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents were analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and Mini Analysis Progrom (Synaptosoft). The last 10 AP-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were averaged to obtain the postsynaptic current amplitude which was used to construct the cumulative distribution as described previously 17. PPF value was derived by the ratio of the second EPSC over the first EPSC and PPD value by the ratio of the second IPSC over the first IPSC. Statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t-test for the mean data and using Kolmogorov-Smirnov for the cumulative distribution of spontaneous and evoked EPSC and IPSC, with the difference to be considered significant at p , 0.05.
