Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from intra-abdominal adipose tissue or liver tissue using RNAiso Plus Isolation Reagent (TAKARA, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reserve transcribed and amplified in a GeneAmp PCR system (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Primers used in the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were of: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL; forward TTC AAG TTT CCT TGC AGA GT; reverse CTC CCA AAC TGA CCC TTA AA) in visceral adipose tissue, acetylCoA carboxylase (ACCase; forward GCC AGC AGA ATT TGT TAC TC; reverse AGA CGA TGC AAT CTT ATC CC) in liver tissue, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward TAT CGG ACG CCT GGT TAC; reverse TGC TGA CAA TCT TGA GGG A). Data analysis was carried out using a GeneGenius automatic gel imaging and analysis system (Syn- gene, Cambridge, UK), and scanned by densitometry for quantitation. To exclude variations as a result of RNA quantity and quality, the data for genes were adjusted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the relative expression levels of ATGL and ACCase were calculated as: (relative gray value of the gene / mean of relative gray value in the control) 9 100%.
