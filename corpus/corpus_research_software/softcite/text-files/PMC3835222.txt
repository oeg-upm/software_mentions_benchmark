All animal procedures were approved by a local Animal Ethics Committee and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (7th Ed). Male C57Bl/6 mice at 12 weeks of age were subjected to open-chest surgery for coronary artery occlusion (CAO) for a period of 15 or 60 minutes, respectively (n=19 per group) or for sham procedure (n=6 per group) as we previously described. 24 Quantification of the myocardium-at-risk and infarct myocardium Myocardium-at-risk and infarct myocardium were identified as described previously with minor modifications. 16,25 Briefly, after cannulation of the ascending aorta, 5% Evans blue was injected into coronary arteries to stain nonischemic myocardium. The LV was then harvested and sectioned into 5 to 7 slices at a thickness of 0.7 mm from the apex to the base and then incubated in 1.5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC in PBS, 30 minutes at 37Â°C). The nonischemic zone (blue area), myocardium-at-risk (nonstained area by Evans blue), and infarct zone (nonstained area by TTC) were outlined and areas quantified digitally using Image J software. Since LV sections were at an equal thickness of 0.7 mm, volumes of myocardium-at-risk and infarct myocardium were also calculated by multiplying differently stained areas of each LV section with 0.7 mm, and expressed as mm 3 per heart. The size of infarct or myocardium-at-risk was expressed aspercentage of the LV.
Cardiac resonance magnetic (CMR) examination post-MI was completed in all 42 patients of the Melbourne cohort at day 3 and in 36 patients at 3 months using a clinical 1.5-T CMR scanner (Sigma HDx 1.5-T, GE Healthcare) following the method previously described. 26,28 Briefly, LV function was assessed by a standard steady state free precession technique called Fast Imaging Employing Steady State Acquisition (FIESTA). LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated by volumetric analysis from a contiguous short axis FIESTA stack covering the LV and right ventricle using the summation of disc method 29 by 2 cardiologists. For determination of myocardium-at-risk, LV short-axis slices covering the whole LV using a T2-weighted triple-inversion recovery breathhold fast spinecho pulse sequence were obtained using a body coil. Myocardium-at-risk was quantified by manual delineation of myocardium with bright signal intensity 2 SD above the mean signal obtained in the remote, noninfarct myocardium and multiplying the slice thickness and the myocardial density of 1.05 g/mL, expressed as a percentage of LV mass. Late enhancement images covering the whole LV were acquired %15 minutes after intravenous administration of a bolus of gadolinium-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA) to identify regional necrosis/fibrosis for infarct size quantification using an inversion recovery gradient echo technique. The area of hyperenhanced myocardium (bounded by endocardial and epicardial contours) on each of the shortaxis slice was manually traced then multiplied by the slice thickness and the myocardial density of 1.05 g/mL to obtain the infarct mass, and expressed as a percentage of LV mass (infarct size). 30 All analyses were performed offline on dedicated workstations running AW SDC 4.4 and IDL version6.3 with ReportCARD version 3.6 by fully blinded observers with excellent reproducibility (r=0.98) for infarct size assessment.
For clinical studies, categorical data are presented as numbers and percentages. Continuous data are presented as meanAESD. All continuous variables were subjected to D'Agostino & Pearson omnibus or the 1-sample KolmogorovSmirnov normality test. If variables failed to pass the test, nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to detect significance among groups with Dunns post-hoc test, and Spearman correlation was performed to detect the correlation between parameters. If variables passed the test, Pearson correlation or standard linear regression was performed to detect the correlation and continuous variables were compared with either unpaired Student's t test or 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. When multiple independent terms were included in regression analyses, stepped entry and removal was used with p for inclusion (PIN) and p for removal (POUT) set at 0.05 and 0.1, respectively. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data analyses were performed with SPSS version 16 or Graphpad Prism 5.0.
