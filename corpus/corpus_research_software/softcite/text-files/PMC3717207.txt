For continuous data, including time course, a reference range approach was used to identify phenotypic variants as detailed in Figures S3A and S3B. Fisher's exact test was used to assess categorical data Figure S3C). These automated calls were complemented by a manual assessment made by biological experts. An example of the establishment of the reference range is given in Figure S2B. Downstream data analysis was performed using SPSS (version 17.0.2), R, and SIMCA-P (V-12.0, Umetrics). The data structure and biological question determined the statistical test used; details are in Table S3. Principal components analysis was performed in SIMCA-P (http://www.umetrics.com).
