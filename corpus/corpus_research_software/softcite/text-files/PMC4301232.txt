Patients were evaluated at one and four months after operation and after starting medical treatment by office visits and telephone inquiry for severity of their endometriotic pain and drug compliance. The patients did not have any other medical or systemic diseases. Before initiation of treatment, liver function tests, serum urea, creatinin, lipids and plasma glucose were checked. We analyzed the data by SPSS 13, using the KS test (One-sample KolmogorovSmirnov test) for normality of data distribution, Levene's test for equality of variances and independent samples t-test for equality of means for comparing quantitative normal data between two groups, paired sample t-tests for comparing quantitative normal data between before and after treatment in each group and Pearson Chi-square test for matching and comparing categorical variables between two groups. According to the KS test, we compared the nonnormal quantitative data by Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test between two groups and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test for comparing before and after treatment data in each group.The categorical variables, before and after medical treatment were analyzed by Mc Nemar test.
