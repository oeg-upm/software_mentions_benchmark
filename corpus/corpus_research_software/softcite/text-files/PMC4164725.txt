To adjust for unequal probabilities of selection and to account for nonparticipation, all estimates were calculated on the basis of the sampling weight. Comparisons between groups were performed using the chi-square test or linear regression analysis. Multivariate regression was performed for the analysis of the association of secondhand smoke exposure and COPD prevalence after adjustment for age, gender, previous diagnosis of asthma or tuberculosis, family income, and education status. All values are presented as mean Â± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was considered at values of p < 0.05.
