Ⓡ DX Seeplex Ⓡ assay system Amplified PCR products were separated and detected by automated gel electrophoresis with the LabChip Ⓡ DX Seeplex Ⓡ assay system (Caliper, Hopkinton, MA, USA). The PCR products from each sample (20 μl) were transferred to 96-well plates and placed in the LabChip Ⓡ DX instrument. The samples were loaded automatically on the Seeplex Ⓡ Chip and detected sequentially according to the sample order. Analysis was performed with designated software (Seegene viewer) that presents each of the samples and identifies the fragments that yield a positive readout for the bands of interest in the presented results. A tabulated matching matrix provides a simple readout, identifying matching bands to the type of STI pathogens. A text file is automatically generated and saved for each tape.
