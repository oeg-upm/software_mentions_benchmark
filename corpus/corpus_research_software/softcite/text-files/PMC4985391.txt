We conducted a meta-analysis to obtain the pooled intervention effect estimates. We expressed the estimates as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes, and as risk difference (RD) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the I 2 statistic to assess the degree of statistical heterogeneity across the included trials. A fixe-model was applied when there was no or low heterogeneity (I 2 < 50%), while a random-effects model was applied when there was substantial heterogeneity (I 2 ! 50%). 19 We used the Review Manager 5.2 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2012) for meta-analysis.
