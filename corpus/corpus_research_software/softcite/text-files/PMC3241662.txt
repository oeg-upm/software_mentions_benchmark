Even though these 5 0 -SS sequences display some affinity for the SRSF1 RBD, our results do not necessarily imply that SRSF1 binds to these sequences within their natural cellular context. Our binding data simply suggest that the 5 0 -SS sequences bear some characteristics of a functional ESE, as predicted by ESEfinder. Moreover, we find that binding affinity does not agree with predictions of the ESEfinder scoring system that were developed based upon ESEs identified by functional SELEX method (Figure 1B and C). This suggests that SRSF1:ESEbinding affinity and splicing efficiency are not necessarily correlated.
