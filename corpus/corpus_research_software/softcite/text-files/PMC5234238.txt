The enrolled children were divided into two groups depending on whether complications due to VZV infection were present, and demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were compared between the two groups. Categorical factors were compared between the two groups using the χ 2 test, and continuous factors were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed P-value＜0.05.
