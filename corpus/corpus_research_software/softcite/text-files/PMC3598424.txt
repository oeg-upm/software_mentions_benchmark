Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (denoted as strain B75) and Xanthomonas translucens pv. translucens (denoted as strain B74) were incubated at 28 °C for 72 h on modified Wilbrink's media and a single colony was selected and grown in nutrient broth for 16 hours at 28 °C. An aqueous suspension of 10 9 colony-forming units ml -1 were inoculated by syringe infiltration on the flag leaf at the 3-leaf stage, and the plants were incubated in the greenhouse. Sterilized water was used as the negative control for inoculation treatments. The bacterial pathogen inoculation was done at 7 dpi with BSMV Era1 or BSMV 0 . In a pilot study, it was determined that the strains used exhibit a compatible interaction with wheat cv. UC1041 (data not shown). Seven days after inoculation with X. translucens, the leaf lesion area was quantified using digital image analysis using ASSESS software (American Phytopathological Society, St. Paul, MN, USA). The experiment was arranged in a completely random design. There were 24 individual treatments (3 bacterial inoculants × 2 water stress conditions × 3 silencing types) and each of these treatments was replicated 24 times. Statistical analysis was carried out using the general linear model of the SAS 9.1 statistical package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Data were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for finding the effect of drought and Era1 silencing on disease, followed by a comparison of the means according to a Duncan's multiple range test at P < 0.05.
