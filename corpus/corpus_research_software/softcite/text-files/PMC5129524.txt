cDNA Library Preparation and Sequencing mRNAseq libraries for sequencing were generated from 1 to 1.5 mg of high quality total RNA, as assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA was purified using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Libraries were made according to the manufacturer's directions for the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, RS-122-2101). Resulting short fragment libraries were checked for quality and quantity using the Bioanalyzer. Equal molar libraries were pooled, requantified and sequenced as 100 bp paired read on the Illumina HiSeq, 2000 instrument using HiSeq Control Software 1.5.15. Following sequencing, Illumina Primary Analysis version RTA 1.13.48 and Secondary Analysis version CASAVA-1.8.2 were run to demultiplex reads for all libraries and generate FASTQ files.
To maximize the utility of this transcriptome assembly, sequences were annotated with the best BLASTx (Camacho et al., 2008) hit to Swissprot (UniProt, 2015) and NCBI's NR database, using an e-value cutoff of 0.001. We also identified PFAM (Finn et al., 2014) domains present in P. flava transcripts using hmmscan, version 3.1b1, from the HMMER package (Eddy, 2011) with an e-value cutoff of 0.01. In addition, we annotated these transcripts with tmhmm, version 2.0c, (Krogh et al., 2001) signalP version 4.1 (Petersen et al., 2011), and ncoils (Lupas et al., 1991). We identified putative transcription factors based on PFAM domain hits using a list from transcriptionfactor.org. For transcripts with multiple isoforms, annotations were collapsed to the gene level as determined by Trinity.
To select genes of interest for clustering, differentially expressed genes (P < 1e-5), having an expression level log2 fold change greater than one or less than negative one, for one or more time points, and having a hit to the Swissprot protein database were identified. These genes were hierarchically clustered on the distances of the Pearson correlation of the log2 fold change, using the complete linkage method to find similar clusters (Figs. 5 and 6, 7, 8). Significantly differentially expressed genes (P < 1e-5) that had transcription factor domains were clustered on the distances of the Pearson correlation of the log2 fold change, using Ward's minimum variance method to find similar clusters (Fig. 9). All heatmaps were created using the R package pheatmap (Kolde, 2013).
Gene Ontology (GO) (Gene Ontology, 2015) terms were assigned to each P. flava gene based upon homologous PFAM domains and significant Swissprot hits. These terms were used to impute functional categories of differentially expressed genes and calculate categorical enrichment. The GO slim terms used were from the generic GO slim terms list available at the Gene Ontology Web site. GO term enrichment was performed using the R package topGO (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2010). To examine higherlevel GO terms, significantly enriched (P < 0.01) GO terms were mapped to select higher-level GO terms using GO.db. These select GO terms were then mapped to the significantly differentially expressed genes (P < 1e-5) (Fig. 10).
