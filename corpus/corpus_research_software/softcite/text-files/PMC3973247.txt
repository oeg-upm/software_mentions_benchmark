Quantification of degeneration. The extent of degeneration was examined after Fluoro-Jade B staining. For quantification of cell death, the cross-sectional tissue area covered by degenerated cells, identified after FluoroJade B staining, was determined on serial sections cut throughout the entire extension of the lesion at an interval of 120 mm. For each animal, the largest cross-sectional area was defined as region of interest (ROI) and copied to all, randomly placed to the ROI (Figure 8b).Counts were performed using the optical fractionator method 8 on a Zeiss (Jena, Germany) Axioskop 2 plus microscope equipped with a motorized stage (Märzhäuser, Wetzlar, Germany), a Ludl MAC 5000 (LEP, Hawthorne, NY, USA) and a digital camera CX 9000 (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT, USA). Stereo Investigator software 6 (MicroBrightField) was used to analyse serial sections (19 mm thick). Statistical analyses were performed by MannWhitney test and Wilcoxon rank test.
To evaluate the content of aggrecan, the main proteoglycan component of the PN, the single supernatant was digested with 0.25 U Chondroitinase ABC (SigmaAldrich, Hamburg, Germany) at 37 1C for 3 h to erase sulphated GAG side chains of the proteoglycan core protein, according to Matthews et al. 44 Electrophoresis and western blotting. To run the SDS page, the volume of the supernatant containing 30 mg protein was added to the same volume of 1 Â SDS sample buffer and denaturized at 75 1C for 15 min. Then the samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with a 4.3% stacking gel and transferred to a poly vinylidene difluoride membrane (Perkin Elmer, Rodgau, Germany). The membrane was probed with anti-aggrecan (AB1031, 1 : 0000, Millipore) and anti-HSP 90 (4874, 1 : 1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) antibodies and finally detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence western blot system (DNR Bio-Imaging systems, Biostep, Jahnsdorf, Germany). The blots were scanned and the ratios of optical band intensities of aggrecan normalized to HSP 90 were calculated using TINA software. Experiments were done in duplicates.
