Interestingly, both resources that utilise Wikipedia describe independently developed quality control procedures for Wikipedia articles. Pfam (and Rfam) uses the Wikipedia API to track new edits and present them to the biocurators for approval to ensure that the changes to the article are appropriate, before the article is displayed on the database website (7). The authors of the GeneWiki project have developed the WikiTrust resource (3), which works via a Firefox plug-in, to mark up Wikipedia articles according to the Wikipedian's reputation. Both approaches have their merits and are both aimed at maintaining quality in the open wiki setting.
