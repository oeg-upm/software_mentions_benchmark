Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics of patients who did and did not develop SSIs were compared using chisquare tests; Fisher's exact tests were used when low expected cell counts were observed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine patient characteristics independently predictive of 30-day SSIs and to assess the difference in likelihood of SSIs at our institution compared to other institutions in the ACS-NSQIP database. Results were considered significant if Pvalues were less than 0.05. Patient characteristics that resulted in a P < 0.05 in the univariate analysis or that were deemed to be clinically relevant were included in the multivariable logistic regression model as independent variables, with the SSI rate as the dependent variable. Statistical analyses were performed in SAS ver. 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).from 2.7% to 5.8%, but this variation was not statistically significant (P = 0.50). The occurrence of 30-day SSIs was significantly greater in ADM patients compared to non-ADM patients nationally (4.3% vs. 3.2%, respectively; P = 0.010). This trend was also observed at our institution (2.1% vs. 1.6%, respectively), although it was not statistically significant (P = 1.00) Table 4).
