The chi-square test was used to compare categorical data. To exclude the outliers, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to identify significant median differences among groups. pvalues <0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA Â® software version 11.0 (StataCorp LP, Lakeway, TX, USA). 17 Fig. 1 presents the flow chart for enrolling the subjects. In total, 638 males with HA, including 37 patients with highresponding inhibitors, were enrolled in the study. The median ages of patients with and without high-responding inhibitors were 31.8 and 26.7 years, respectively, and the median patient-months followed for the same groups were 48 and 48 years, respectively Table 1). The differences in median age and other age categories were not statistically significant.
