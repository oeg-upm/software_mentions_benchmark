To analyze RNA present in sucrose gradient fractions, each fraction was treated with 100 g/ml proteinase K (Roche) in the presence of 1% SDS and 10 mM EDTA for 30 min at 42 â€¢ C, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNA pellets were resuspended in formamide and separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing 1.3% formaldehyde (34). RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N, GE Biosciences) and RNA was visualized by methylene blue staining. Individual RNA species were detected by Northern hybridizations using 32 Plabeled oligonucleotide probes as described (35). Sequences of hybridization probes used in this study are listed in Supplemental Table S2. Hybridizations were analyzed using a Typhoon 9200 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Biosciences).
