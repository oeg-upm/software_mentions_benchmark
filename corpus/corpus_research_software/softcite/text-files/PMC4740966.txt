To estimate the impact of pregnancy-related cervical cancer on the cost of inpatient care at delivery, we compared the mean, per women, direct medical cost between discharges with and without a cervical cancer diagnosis. Economic analyses were restricted to 2001-2009 since reliable CCRs to convert charges to costs were not available prior to 2001. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and the Joinpoint Regression Program, version 4.0.1. [17]. This study was considered exempt from institutional review board approval because of the de-identified nature of the data.
