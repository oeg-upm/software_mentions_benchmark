Statistical methods. Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistic v19.0. Immunohistochemical results tested for association with survival outcomes using Cox regression or Kaplan-Meier (log-rank test) included; continuous IRS, continuous percentage of stained cells, categorical staining intensity and categorical heterogeneity (also classified as 100% staining vs o100% staining). Three survival outcomes were tested; TTBR, PFS and OS. All time intervals were measured in relation to the commencement of BRAF inhibitor. Follow-up for patients who subsequently received dabrafenib and trametinib combination (CombiDT) therapy (n Â¼ 5) was censored at date of cross-over to CombiDT therapy, as response rates of 19% and a median PFS of 3.6 months have been reported in this patient population (Flaherty et al, 2011). Follow-up for one patient who discontinued therapy after best response but before progressive disease was censored at date of BRAF inhibitor cessation. Multivariate survival models were also tested for PFS and OS in the overall cohort adjusting for age, sex, presence of active (untreated, or previously treated but relapsed) brain metastases (BM), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and ongoing treatment with BRAF inhibitor after RECISTdefined disease progression. Pearson's correlation and MannWhitney U-methods were used to test all staining parameters for association with best CT response in terms of best per cent change (sum of diameters target lesions baseline to best response) and also coded categorically as a partial response; no patient experienced a complete response. A subgroup response and survival correlate analysis was conducted excluding patients who had BM at trial commencement.
