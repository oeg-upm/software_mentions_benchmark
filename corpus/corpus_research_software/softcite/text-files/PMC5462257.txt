Mosquito surveillance data provided by DPH was analyzed for years 2015 and 2016 to date. The geographical distribution of counties conducting surveillance, total number and percentage by mosquito species collected in 2015 were compared to 2016 data. The distribution of counties conducting surveillance was mapped using ArcMap 10.4.1 for pre and post Zika response. Autochthonous vector transmission risk was evaluated based on the overall numbers and percentages of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes collected for 2016.
