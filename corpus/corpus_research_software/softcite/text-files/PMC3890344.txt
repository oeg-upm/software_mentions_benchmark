For RNAi knockdown, we designed pairs of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (one encoding target pre-miRNA and the other corresponding its complement) for 10 potential target sequences by using RNAi Designer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA;https://rnaidesigner.invitrogen.com/rnaiexpress/). After annealing, the double-stranded oligonucleotides were individually cloned into the pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miRNA vector (Invitrogen). Knockdown effects of each construct were evaluated by cotransfection with a Nel-AP expression vector into HEK293T cells, followed by measurement of AP activity in the culture media. The two mostpositive cells in transfected retinal regions was scored in a highpower optic field and compared with that in equivalent regions of the contralateral (untransfected) retinas or corresponding control areas. At least three fields were examined for each retina, and at least six retinas were analyzed for each type of treatment. Equal numbers of nasally and temporally transfected retinas were analyzed.
