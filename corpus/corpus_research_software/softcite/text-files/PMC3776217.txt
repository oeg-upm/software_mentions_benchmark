Microscopy experiments typically used 8-well microscope chambered slides and a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000 U epifluorescence microscope equipped with blue DAPI (Exciter: D360/40x, Dichroic: 400DCLP, Emitter: 460/50m), green FITC (Exciter: D360/40X, Dichroic: 400DCLP, Emitter: HQ535/50m), and deep-red Cy5 (Exciter: HQ620/60X, Dichroic: 660LP, Emitter: HQ700/75m) filters. Images were acquired using a Photometrics 512 B black and white digital camera using Metamorph Software V6.2. Images were analyzed and prepared using the ImageJ open source software package (available for free download at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).
Aliquots (1 mL) from separate cultures of ten different strains of bacteria (grown to OD 600 = 0.5) were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 minutes. The pellets were washed with and then resuspended in 1 mL of 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). The bacterial dispersions were added to separate glass slides and each slide sample was treated with one of four Tetra-ZnDPA probes (10 µM); 15 minutes later multiple brightfield image fields were acquired of each of the forty probe/bacteria samples. Using ImageJ software, five digital images of each bacteria/probe sample were randomly selected; the bacterial clusters within each image field were digitally encircled as regions of interest and the average area of these clusters was calculated. For each strain of bacteria, the average cluster size induced by each of the four different probes was normalized by setting the largest observed cluster size to a relative value of 1.0. The final results listed in Table 1. Table 1. Relative agglutination ability of molecular probes measured by Slide Agglutination Assay.
All animal care and procedures were approved by the Notre Dame Institutional Advisory Committee of Animal Care. Hairless mice (strain SKH1) were anesthetized using 2-3 % v/v isoflurane before infection, probe injection, and imaging. Infection was achieved by injecting a bolus of S. aureus Xen29 (~10 8 CFU) into the left rear leg of each mouse and 50 µL of sterile growth media was injected into the right rear leg. The mice were then allowed to recover for 3 hours before intravenous injection with either Bis-SR-bZnDPA or Tetra-SR-bZnDPA (10 nmol in water) via the tail vein. Fluorescent dorsal images of the anesthetized mice were acquired for 5 s (Ex 640 ± 25, Em 732 ± 37 nm, binning 2 x 2, f/stop 2, field-of-view 125 mm), using a Xenogen IVIS Lumina that generated 16-bit TIFF format files. Region-of-interest analysis of the in vivo images was performed using ImageJ software and circling the appropriate anatomical location of each mouse. The average pixel intensities of the target (T), non-target (NT), and were measured and statistical analyses of the cohort produced an average ratio for T/NT with a standard error of the mean.
After imaging studies, the mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation (2-3 % v/v) and euthanized by cervical dislocation. The major organs were dissected, placed on low reflectance paper, and imaged using the same fluorescence settings described above. The biodistribution was determined by region-of-interest analysis using ImageJ software. Free-hand shapes were drawn around each organ and mean pixel intensity values were measured. The different organs attenuate a probe's deep-red emission intensity to a slightly different degree, depending on tissue thickness and pigmentation. The biodistribution analysis in Figure 8 assumes that fluorescence from both probes in a specific organ suffer the same amount of signal attenuation and thus, the average pixel intensities reflect relative probe concentration in the organ.
