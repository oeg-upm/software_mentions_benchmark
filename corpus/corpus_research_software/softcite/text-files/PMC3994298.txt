Each section in the L4-5 segment of the spinal cord in each experimental animal was divided by laminae I-II and laminae III-VI regions according to the cytoarchitecture in the spinal cord. The number of c-Fos-positive neurons was automatically detected and counted using the MetaMorph software (Ver. 4.6, Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA, US) under ten magnifications through a microscope (Olympus BX51 microscope, Tokyo, Japan) mounted with a CCD camera (Cool SNAP, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, US).
All data were assessed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 15.0 program (SPSS Ver. 15.0,SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, US) and were presented as meanÂ± S.E.M. Differences between either the behavioral test or the counting of c-Fos-positive neurons were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post-hoc pair wise comparisons. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
