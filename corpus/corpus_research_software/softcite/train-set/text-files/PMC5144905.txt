The study data were summarized by the descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, maximum, frequency, and percentage). The difference between two independent groups showing a nonnormal distribution was investigated using Mann-Whitney U test. The relation between categorical variables was tested either by the chisquare test or by the Fisher's exact test. A linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the relation between the cost and duration of a hospitalization. The level of statistical significance was determined as 0.05. Analyses were performed using the MedCalc statistical software program (Version 12.7.7; MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium;http://www.medcalc.org; 2013).
