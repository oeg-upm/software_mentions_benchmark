Adult mice were euthanized with CO 2 overdose and sequentially perfused with ice-cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were collected and postfixed with 4% PFA for 4-6 hr or overnight at 4 C. Postfixed brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose solution in PBS for 24 hr and cut into 40-mm-thick sections with a sliding microtome (Leica). Brain sections were serially collected and stored in antifreezing solution at À20 C. Immunohistochemistry was performed essentially as previously described (Niu et al., 2011). Briefly, free-floating sections were rinsed with PBS and blocked with blocking solution (3% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. These sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for at least 24 hr at 4 C followed by three rinses with PBST buffer (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS). They were subsequently incubated with respective secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for over 2 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 when appropriate. After extensive rinsing with PBST buffer, sections were mounted onto glass slides for microscopy. The following primary antibodies were used: GFP (A-11122, rabbit, 1:500, Invitrogen; GFP,Cell Signaling Technology), CC-1 (OP80; mouse; 1:500; Calbiochem), and ASCL1 (TX-518; guinea pig; 1:10,000; Jane Johnson). Alexa-488-, Alexa-Fluor-594-, or Alexa-Fluor-647-conjugated corresponding secondary antibodies from Jackson ImmunoResearch were used for indirect fluorescence. Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. A Cell Counter software plugin in the ImageJ program was used to count cells. Data were obtained from 12 random sections from three to five mice in each group.
Adult mice were deeply anesthetized and transcardially perfused with chilled (4 C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 11 mM D-glucose at pH 7.4, 300 mOsm, and aerated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ), including 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 1% kynurenate acid. The striatum with overlying neocortex was then dissected out. Acute sagittal slices (250 mm thickness) were collected between +2 mm and À2 mm from bregma on a Leica VT1200S slicer. They were then incubated in aerated ACSF with 3 mM CaCl 2 and 2 mM MgCl 2 to recover for 30 min at 35 C followed by additional incubation for over 1 hr at room temperature. A single slice was then transferred to a submersion chamber and perfused at 3 ml/min with aerated ACSF at 30 C. Lineage-traced cells in the striatum were identified under visual guidance using IR-DIC optics and tdTomato fluorescence. Whole-cell currentclamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed using glass pipettes ($6-9 MU) filled with intracellular solution (0.2 mM EGTA, 130 mM K-gluconate, 6 mM KCl, 3 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.4 mM GTP-Na, and 14 mM phosphocreatine-Tris at pH 7.2 and 285 mOsm). Intracellular solution was supplemented with 0.5% biocytin (B4261; Sigma) for biocytin labeling. All recordings were obtained with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz, acquired, and digitized at 10 kHz using Clampex 10.3 (Molecular Devices). APs were recorded in current clamp mode and elicited by a series of current injections starting from À160 pA with 20-, 40-, 80-, or 160-pA increments and 800 ms duration. Sodium and potassium currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode in response to a series of voltage steps ranging from À60 mV to +60 mV at 10-mV increments and 100 ms duration. Delayed rectifier potassium currents (K d ) were measured 50 ms prior to the end of current step. Spontaneous synaptic currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode. In all voltage-clamp recordings, cells were clamped at À60 mV or À80 mV, whichever is close to the resting membrane potential of the cell except during the voltage-step protocol. In all current-clamp recordings, recordings were made at the resting membrane potential or without any current injection. Series and input resistance were measured in voltage-clamp mode with a 400 ms, À10 mV step from a À60 mV holding potential (filtered by 10 kHz, sampled at 50 kHz). Cells were accepted only if the series resistance was less than 30 MU and stable throughout the experiment. Data analysis was performed inClampfit 10.3 (Molecular Devices).
