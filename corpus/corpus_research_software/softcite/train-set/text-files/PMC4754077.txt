High resolution T1-weighted anatomic images were acquired on a GE 3T Excite MRI system. Automated reconstruction and volumetric segmentation of images were conducted using FreeSurfer 5.1 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), which is widely used and provides accurate renderings of regional volumes without rater bias. We used an imaging protocol that maximizes differentiation of the white and gray matter boundary (3D spoiled gradient-recalled at steady state, TE 3.0 ms, TR 7.8 ms, TI 600, 8° flip angle, NEX 1, 1-mm axial slice thickness, FOV 25.6 cm, 256 × 256 matrix). MRIs for each participant were motion corrected, normalized for intensity in homogeneities, and transformed to Talairach space. Non-brain tissue was removed using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure, subcortical structures were segmented, and further intensity normalization was conducted. This was followed by white-matter segmentation, tessellation of the gray-white matter boundary, and automated topology correction. Finally, surface deformation following intensity gradients optimally placed the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid borders at the location where the greatest shift in intensity defines the transition to the other tissue class. The cerebral cortex was parcellated into 34 gyral-based regions in each hemisphere based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas [33]. Subcortical structures were delineated by an algorithm that examines variations in voxel intensities and spatial relationships. Anatomical accuracy of the segmentations was manually verified. To account for differences in head size, volumes for each region were divided by intracranial volume (ICV).
