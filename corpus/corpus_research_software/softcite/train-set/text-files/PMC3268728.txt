HeLa cells were plated in eight-chamber slides at 10,000 cells/well. After serum starvation, cells underwent different treatments as indicated in the figure legends. After fixation with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, followed by 1 h of blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were stained with primary antibodies, rabbit anti-RSK1, rabbit anti-phospho-T573 RSK, rabbit anti-AKAP95, or mouse anti-HA antibody overnight at 4°C. Fluorescence staining was performed using Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (green) or Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (red). Confocal microscopy was performed using a multiphoton Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a C-Apo 40×/1.2 water lens. Confocal images were acquired with LSM 510 software. Nonconfocal images were acquired with an Olympus IX81 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) equipped with 40×/0.60 lens and Retiga EXi digital camera (QImaging, Surrey, Canada). For quantification, the fluorescence densities in the nucleus or cytoplasm were analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).
