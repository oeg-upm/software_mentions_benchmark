All the tests were conducted automatically by Hitachi 911. Data was analyzed using SPSS 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, US). The Fisher's exact test was used to analyze qualitative data and student's t-test for quantitative data. Weight changes were analyzed by chi-square test while Pearson's correlation test was used to assess correlations. Moreover, paired t-test was used for comparing blood pressure changes before and after the intervention in both groups and independent t-test was used for comparing mean concentration changes between the two groups. To detect the correlations between variables, Pearson's regression analysis was used.
