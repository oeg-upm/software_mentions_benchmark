Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS software (Version 21.0) for Windows. The values of the variables are presented as arithmetic means with standard deviations or as frequencies or other descriptive statistical forms. The dominant genetic model was used, and the associations of having at least one minor allele versus having two wild-type alleles were tested. Association tests between the genotypes and the demographic traits were carried out with χ 2 tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests. Association tests between the genotypes and the clinical responses were performed using analysis of covariance, with the current antipsychotic dose acting as a confounder. The differences in allele frequencies between responsive and resistant schizophrenic patients were assessed using χ 2 tests. The limit of statistical significance was set at 0.05.
