Bacterial strains and typing The bacterial strains used in this study were the clinical isolate of Staphylococcus condimenti from the described case, hereafter referred to as S. condimenti StO 2014-01, and the S. condimenti DSM 11674 type strain (CCUG 39902T) [3] isolated from soy sauce mash. Bacterial cultures were identified by MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics) with MALDI Biotyper software. Identification to the species level was defined as log scores 2.0, and identification to the genus level on log scores between 1.7 and 1.9, based on the manufacturer's guidelines. Antibacterial susceptibility testing was performed with agar disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration testing by agar gradient diffusion. Interpretation of results was based on EUCAST/ NordicAST breakpoints for staphylococci. 16S rDNA was sequenced with PCR primers covering V1-V9 and Sanger sequencing using BigDye Terminator v 3.1 and ABI Hitachi 3130 XL Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Whole genome sequencing and assembly Bacterial cells were treated with proteinase K (2 mg/mL) and lysostaphin (0.1 mg/mL) for 15 minutes with shaking at 37°C, before heating for 15 minutes at 65°C. Genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen MagAttract DNA Mini M48 kit onQiagen BioRobot M48. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT sample prep kit, and were sequenced on the MiSeq platform with 300 bp paired-end reads (MiSeq Reagent Kit v3). MinION libraries were prepared from genomic DNA sheared by G-tube (Covaris) using the SQMAP-004 kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The MinION library was sequenced on a R7.3 flow cell using the MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Raw data were basecalled using Metrichor software (r7.X 2D Basecalling rev 1.12), and extracted using Poretools [5]. Data from two Nextera XT libraries and one MinION library (2D filtered reads) were hybrid assembled using the SPAdes Genome Assembler (v3.5.0) [6]. Contigs were assembled and circularized using the Geneious Assembler (Biomatters). The complete genome was annotated using the Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) [7]. The S. condimenti StO 2014-01 chromosome and plasmid sequences were deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank with accession numbers NZ_CP018776 and NZ_CP018777 respectively.
Accessions of the reference genome sequences used in this study are provided in Table 2. BRIG [8] was used for whole genome comparison. Proteins were considered to be homologs having at least 90% sequence identity over at least 60% alignment length. ClustalX2 [9] and FigTree v1.4.2 were used for sequence alignments and phylogeny. Putative virulence factors were identified by protein sequence blast against the Virulence Factors Database using BLAST+ and PfamScan against the Pfam-A database. Putative horizontally transferred pathogenicity islands were identified using  Alien Hunter [10].
