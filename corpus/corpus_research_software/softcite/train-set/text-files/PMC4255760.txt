After electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel, ethidium bromide-stained bands were visualized by ultraviolet transillumination, and the fluorescence intensity was semiquantified using a Bio2239 gel analysis system (Bio-Print, Chicago, IL).
The cells positively stained with anti-GRP94 primary antibody appeared with brown-yellow granules in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. The intensity of immunohistochemical staining was analyzed using Image-Pro-Plus image analysis software. An average gray value supplied by the software was used to reference the intensity of GRP94 staining (ie, normalized to an internal control).
Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) and are presented as mean AE standard deviation. Statistical significance was determined using 1-way analysis of variance. P < 0.05 was recognized as significantly different.
