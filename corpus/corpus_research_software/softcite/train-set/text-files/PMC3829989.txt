The possible direct interaction of the three lignans with IDO was simulated, 3D geometries of trachelogenin, arctigenin, and matairesinol were calculated with Discovery Studio [ 13 ] and energetically minimized with Omega 2.2.1. [ 14 ]. The docking simulation was performed with the software package MOE 2011.10 [ 15 ] using the X-ray crystal structure of IDO (Protein Data Bank entry 2d0t ) [ 16 ]. A pharmacophore of the metal binding feature was generated within LigandScout 3.03 [ 17 ] based on the ligand (4-phenyl-imidazole) cocrystallized in the crystal structure and used as a constraint in the docking simulation. This means that the docked ligand must form a coordinated interaction with the heme iron ion from the IDO active site. For the docking, the A chain of 2d0t, which was crystallized as a dimer, was used. The original ligand 4-phenyl-imidazole, the two co-crystallized detergent molecules of 2-[ N -cyclohexylamino]ethane sulfonic acid, and water were removed. The binding site of the original ligand was chosen for the docking. The program defines the open space in the binding pocket with so called alpha spheres that represent available atom positions. Placement was done by the triangle matcher algorithm using standard settings. The triangle matcher algorithm generates poses by aligning triplets of ligand atoms with triplets of alpha spheres to find possible binding orientations of the ligand within the binding site.
