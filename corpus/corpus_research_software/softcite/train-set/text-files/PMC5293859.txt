We conducted all statistical analyses using SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). p Values were two-sided and statistical significance was determined using the p value of <0.05. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the cumulative incidence proportions tested for or diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhoea following completion of the first sexual behaviour questionnaire. As previously done, diagnosis rates were calculated among tested and untested participants 2 thus underestimating true incidence since asymptomatic infections among those untested are excluded from the numerator.
