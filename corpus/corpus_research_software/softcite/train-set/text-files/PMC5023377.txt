Histological analysis. Mice were sacrificed at day 28 (for acute EAE) or day 120 (for chronic EAE) p.i. and transcardially perfused with PBS. Brain and lumbar spinal cords were harvested for pathological assessment and spleen for immunological assessment. CNS tissues were cut into 7 μm sections, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for assessment of inflammation and Luxol fast blue (LFB) for demyelination. Slides were assessed and scored in a blinded fashion for inflammation 57 : 0, none; 1, a few inflammatory cells; 2, organization of perivascular infiltrates; and 3, abundant perivascular cuffing with extension into the adjacent tissue. For demyelination quantification, total white matter was manually outlined, and area (%) of demyelination was calculated by Image-Pro Plus software. 58 For immunohistochemistry, brain and spinal cord tissues were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 day and then cryo-protected using 30% sucrose solution for 3 days. Fixed tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Japan) for frozen sections and then sectioned coronally at 12 μm. Transverse sections of brain and spinal cord were cut, and stained with different antibodies. Immunofluorescence controls were routinely generated by omitting primary antibodies. Results were visualized by fluorescent microscopy (Nikon Eclipse E600; Nikon, Melville, NY) or confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For the quantifications of HE, FB, iNOS + Iba1 + , Arg1 + Iba1 + , APP + , GFAP + and MBP + , ten areas in the white matter at the lumbar spinal cord were selected (Supplementary Figure S3).
For surface-marker staining, cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated Abs to CD4, CD8, CD11b, and CD11c (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or isotype control Abs for 30 minutes on ice. For intracellular staining, splenocytes or CNS-infiltrating MNCs were stimulated with 25 and 10 μg/ml MOG peptide for 72 hours or overnight, respectively, followed by stimulation with 50 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin in the presence of GolgiPlug for 5 hours. Cells were surfacestained with mAbs against CD4 and CD8. Cells were then washed, fixed, and permeabilized with FIX&PERM solution (Invitrogen), and intracellular cytokines were stained with Abs against IL-17, IFN-γ, or GM-CSF (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on FACSAria (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as mean ± SD. When comparing multiple groups, data were analyzed by analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test. A significance criterion of P < 0.05 was used for all statistical analysis.
