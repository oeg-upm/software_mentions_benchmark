A femoral or jugular venous approach was used for right heart catheterization. Cardiac output and cardiac index were calculated by saturation measurement according to Fick's method. PAP, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and right ventricular and right atrial pressures were measured during breath hold in baseline over at least 3 heart cycles. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was calculated by integration of the pressure curve by Metek software (Metek GmbH, Roetgen, Germany). Pulmonary vascular resistance was derived from pulmonary vascular resistance = (mean pulmonary artery pressure Ã€ pulmonary capillary wedge pressure)/ cardiac output.
Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS version 18.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism v5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used for plotting. Normal distribution was assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results are expressed as meanAESD. A P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. For comparison of invasive and noninvasive measurements of sPAP and RAP, linear regression analyses were conducted and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated. Bland-Altman analyses were carried for sPAP and RAP measurements to show systematic deviations. For discrimination of sPAP threshold, receiver operating characteristics analysis was conducted. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as accuracy were analyzed for different cut-off values.
