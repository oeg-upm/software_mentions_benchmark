Depending on vessel type/cellular context, distinct cellular mechanisms are used alternatively or in combination during vascular lumen scope. Confocal images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil objective. Time-lapse series of HUVECs expressing the singlechain Raichu/Cdc42 FRET probe (Aoki and Matsuda, 2009) were collected every 1 min for 30-60 min on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope equipped with Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.4 oil objective. Images were collected every minute for a total of 30-60 min. For ultrastructural analysis, collagen gels were prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Briefly, gels were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 75 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 3 h at 4°C, followed by overnight wash in 114 mM PBS. Gels were subsequently postfixed in 1% OsO 4 reduced with 1% K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] in 1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4°C, washed twice in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were cut, mounted onto copper grids, and viewed with a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope (FEI). Digital images were acquired with a MegaViewIII camera controlled with iTEM software (Olympus Soft Imaging Systems, Germany) and then postprocessed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and Adobe Illustrator.
Fiji was used for image processing and extraction of quantitative data. For quantitative analysis of VE-cadherin, PDXL, active Cdc42, and p-aPKC, the average fluorescence intensity in regions of interest (ROIs) located in the luminal area was measured usingImageJ software. A total of 35-50 ROIs from 3D images pooled from three independent experiments was analyzed. To determine VE-cadherin junctional length and the percentage of luminal perimeter coated with PDXL, the line scan function of ImageJ was used on 25-30 junctions/lumens from three independent experiments. Images from FRET time-lapse series were processed with Fiji. Briefly, a binary mask was derived from the YFP image and was multiplied separately with the TFP and FRET images. Then FRET images were divided by TFP images to obtain FRET/TFP ratio images. A rainbow color LUT was applied, and brightness and contrast were adjusted to display the ratio FRET images in an intensity-modulated manner by which red indicates high and blue indicates low FRET efficiency, respectively. For quantitative analysis, YFP-masked FRET and TFP images were thresholded to measure pixel intensity of each individual image in the stack, and FRET/TFP intensity ratios were calculated as previously described (Chaki et al., 2013). For statistical purposes, time-lapse series were acquired from four to six cells/group. Experiments were repeated three times.
