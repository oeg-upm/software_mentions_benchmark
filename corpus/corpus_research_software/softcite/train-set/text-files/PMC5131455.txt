It is necessary to establish collaborations between human and veterinary medicine, food authorities, and environmental sectors, and these different sectors should collect data from both humans and animals. These data include the emerging and reemerging zoonotic pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and parasites) and the prevalence, variation, genomic data, and the life cycle of the natural reservoir, as well as antibiotic use and antibiotic sensitivity. Moreover, a database is needed and should be available to scientists from different fields. One successful example in Denmark is an automated program referred to as Vetstat, which has been introduced to collect quantitative data regarding all prescribed animal medicines from veterinarians, pharmacies, and feed mills to control microbial resistance (76).
