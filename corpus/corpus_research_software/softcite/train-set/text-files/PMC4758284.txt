Examination of cell viability. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay (cat. no. M2128; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a concentration of 5x10 4 and allowed to adhere. Following treatment for different time intervals, 100 µl MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added into the cells and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 37˚C. Subsequently, the supernatant was removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (cat. no. D2650; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to dissolve the resultant formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at 570 nm (EL309 Automated Microplate Reader; Bio-Tek Instruments, lnc., Winooski, VT, USA). Six wells were measured for each group and the experiment was repeated three times.Statistical analysis. SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data analysis. All experiments were repeated three times and data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
