The selected chemicals as putative inhibitors of PCSK9-LDLR interaction were purchased from ChemBridge (San Diego, CA, USA). The polyclonal antibody against the LDLR was raised in rabbits using the synthetic peptide spanning the C-terminus of the bovine LDLR (amino acids 832-841) as described previously. 16 Other reagents otherwise not specified were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) or prepared as described previously. 17 In silico screening of the chemical library Amino acids from 367 to 381 within PCSK9 where the EGF-A domain of the LDLR binds were considered to be the target of the inhibitors. The initial crystal structure of PCSK9 from the Protein Data Bank was constructed in the presence of the EGF-A domain of the LDLR at neutral pH. After removal of the EGF-A domain, the PCSK9 structure was remodeled by removal of water molecules and supplementation of hydrogen atoms. The docking scores of chemicals from the ChemBridge Express collection (~450,000 chemicals) were calculated using GOLD software version 4.0.1. 18 A maximum of ten docked poses were calculated for each chemical, with a searching efficiency of 200%. The top 100 chemicals with the highest Chemscore were selected for further evaluation.
The correlation between the order of docking scores and experimental variables (relative inhibition, Dil-LDL uptake, and amounts of LDLR, and PCSK9) was analyzed by Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient method using SPSS software (version 20, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). All statistical tests were bilateral, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
