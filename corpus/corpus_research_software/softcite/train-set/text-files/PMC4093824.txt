GEMMA tests the alternative hypothesis H 1 :0 against the null hypothesis H 0 : = 0 for each SNP. To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we obtained adjusted p values by using the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), adjusted p-value 0.2 significance level is used. An overview of the test results was shown as a Manhattan plot constructed by the statistical package R. Base pair position of SNP markers were given based on the chicken genome assembly build WASHUC2. Inflation factor was calculated by the R package GenABEL with "median" option (Aulchenko et al., 2007).
The genome-wide association study revealed 12 significantly associated SNPs that surpassed the significance level Figure 2, Table 2). As genomic inflation factor is 0.987, it can be concluded that the GWAS result is not inflated by considering relatedness using GEMMA (Figure 3). Among the significant SNPs, we identified 4 susceptibility SNPs: rs14339964 (Gga3:36327458, p = 4.07 10 -9 ), GGaluGA344987 (Gga3:705798, p = 1.1210 -6 ),) in the population (Table 2). SNP rs14339964 at Gga3:36327458 is located in an intron region of AKT3 which is known to be regulators of cell signaling in response to insulin and growth factors and involved in a wide variety of biological processes. AKT3 is one of the key genes in the formation of melanoma cells (Tsao et al., 2012). Previous studies reported that through gene-environment interactions pigmentation pathways can contribute to the formation for melanoma and tumours (Gudbjartsson et al., 2008; Ibarrola- Villava et al., 2012). Thus, we indirectly infer that AKT3 mutations may be related to plumage pigmentation. Both SNPs, GGaluGA344987 at Gga3:705798 and rs14641648 at Gga8:12987908, are located in an intergenic region around KRT7 and PAP2 which are associated with pigmentation. PAP2 is another name of LPPR5 which has been found to Tail increase pigmentation (Shan et al., 2009). KRT7 is a member of the keratin gene family and is related with melanocytic tumors (Blum et al., 2010). DDX6 encodes a member of the DEAD box protein family, which has multiple functions including translation suppression and mRNA degradation (Weston and Sommerville, 2006). DDX6 is a previously confirmed gene for vitiligo which is a disease related with pigmentation of skin (Tang et al., 2012). Interestingly, although rs15175679 (Gga20: 8397089, p = 3.9110 -6 ) is not significant, the variant exits in gga-mir-668 which is a region that harbors a small RNA. Previous studies of chicken embryogenesis has shown that this small RNA regulates developmental signaling pathways (Shao et al., 2012). The results of GWAS of head plumage, wing plumage, breast plumage, back plumage, neck plumage and tail plumage traits, separately identified the same SNPs: rs14339964 and rs15616451 (near gene: AKT3, ENSGALG00000020136) as the result of GWAS with the whole body trait. Through the concordant result, we infer that quantitative analysis of whole body plumage is not a simple trait (Table 3).
