For incident abdominal obesity cases, the time of abdominal obesity occurrence was assumed to be the midpoint between the visit at which abdominal obesity was first diagnosed and the baseline visit (2005). The person years were calculated as the sum of follow-up times from the baseline until an assumed time of abdominal obesity development or until the final examination of each individual. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident abdominal obesity comparing the mild and moderate to severe NAFLD categories vs. the normal group. The data were adjusted, first for age alone, then for the multiple covariates. In the multivariate models, we included variables that might confound the relationship between the NAFLD and abdominal obesity, which include: age, baseline WC, total cholesterol, log(hsCRP), HOMA-IR, eGFR, current smoking status, regular exercise, hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The change level of WC was calculated by following formula: WC on censoring time -baseline WC. The average change of WC was compared among 3 groups (normal, mild and moderate to severe NAFLD groups) by one-way ANOVA and Ï‡ 2 -test. P values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
