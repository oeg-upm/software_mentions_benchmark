Sample size was calculated using Statcalc (Epi-Info, version 3.5.3). According to public health statistics for Natal, the city has a 7.9% rate of premature live births (18). Since the maternity hospital at which the study was conducted hosts an average of 200 births per month, a sample of 90 recently-delivered mothers was needed to ensure a 95% confidence level. Samples were collected between January and September of 2010.
Alpha-tocopherol was identified and quantified in samples by comparing the area of the chromatographic profile with the area for standard α-tocopherol (Sigma ® , St. Louis, MO, USA). The concentration of the standard was confirmed against the specific extinction coefficient in absolute ethanol for α-tocopherol (ε 1%, 1cm=75.8 to 292nm) (22). Statistical analysis was performed using the open source statistical software R, version 2.15. The results for α-tocopherol concentrations in colostrum were expressed as means with standard deviations. Numerical variables were shown not to be normal, by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, characterizing the samples as parametric.
