Tumor histology. Tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 µm) were cut and stained with H&E. Representative sections of liver, heart, and kidney were scanned with a Scanscope CS slide scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA), visualized with ImageScope software (Aperio Technologies), and composed in Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA). Images were adjusted in brightness, contrast, and color balance for a more uniform appearance of the H&E stain. These adjustments do not obscure, eliminate, or misrepresent any information presented in the original slides. Original objective lens magnification was 20×. All images were reviewed by a veterinary pathologist.
