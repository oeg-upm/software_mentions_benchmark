Flow cytometry based binding assays. Mid-log phase P. aeruginosa strains were concentrated in PBS to an OD 650 of 2.0. After incubation of antibody (10 µg/ml) and bacteria (1e7 cells) for 1 h at 4°C with shaking, washed cells were incubated with an Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-human IgG antibody (Invitrogen) for 0.5 h at 4°C. Washed cells were stained with BacLight Green Bacterial Stain as recommended (Invitrogen). For ex vivo binding, 0.1 ml of bacterial inocula was prepared from an overnight TSA plate and delivered intraperitoneally to BALB/c mice. 4 h after challenge, bacteria were harvested, and RBCs were lysed, sonicated, and resuspended in PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 and 1% BSA. Samples were stained and run on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD) and analyzed using FAC- SDiva (v. 6.1.3; BD) and FlowJo (v. 9.2; Tree Star).
Octet measurements. Affinity of antibodies was analyzed using the ForteBio Octet 384 instrument with 384 slanted well plates (ForteBio). PAO1 was grown overnight at 37°C at 200 RPM, followed by removal of cells by centrifugation. The culture supernatant, which served as the Psl source, was then loaded onto Octet aminopropylsilane (hydrated in PBS) sensors (300 s). The sensors were blocked with PBS-B (300 s), followed by the addition of anti-Psl mAbs that ranged from 7.8 to 10,000 nM (400 s). Disassociation was performed with PBS-B (400 s). For Octet carbohydrate capture experiments, antibodies were loaded onto aminopropylsilane (hydrated in PBS) sensors (300 s) at 10 µg/ml, followed by blocking with PBS-B (100 s). Enriched carbohydrate solution was then flowed over the sensors (300 s), followed by washing to remove unbound material (100 s). Unlabeled antibodies (10 µg/ml) were then flowed over the sensors. All steps were performed using a 3-mm sensor offset with 0.6 Hz sensitivity. Data were exported to Prism (GraphPad) for analysis of binding and for Global Association/Disassociation affinity curve fitting.
