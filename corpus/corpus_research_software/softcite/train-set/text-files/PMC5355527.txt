This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2014 to May 2015, in an Iranian petrochemical company with 325 employees, located at Asalouyeh, in the southern part of Iran in which methanol was produced as the final product. The sample size was determined with reference to a study by Naqvi et al [13]. Taking the b (power) of 80% and a (the first type error) ¼ 5% into consideration, using Medcalc software (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium) the sample size was calculated to be 125. Participants were randomly selected from the personal list provided by the company.
Upon completion of the field survey and data collection, data were transferred into the computer for statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between quantitative variables such as stress, job satisfaction, and productivity scores. To assess the factors affecting productivity, linear regression analysis was applied. In all tests, the significance level was set at 0.05.According to Table 2, the mean score of job stress was calculated to be 181.27 AE 24.17 indicating "moderate-high" level of stress. One-way ANOVA, independent t test and Pearson coefficient statistical procedures did not show any significant relationship between the mean job stress score and demographic characteristics of the participants. Additionally, the statistical analyses revealed no significant relationship between the mean scores of job stress and job satisfaction (p ¼ 0.152) and productivity.
