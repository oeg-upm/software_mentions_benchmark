To identify the "sections" of the phantom selected for the experiment, zinc oxide and eugenol dotted portions were added at each channel intersection (Fig. 2), and the letters A, B, C, and D and the numbers 1 through 10 were applied for identification (Fig. 3). 6 After obtaining the real measurements, the phantom was scanned in the i-CAT device, following an image acquisition protocol of a 6-cm × 16-cm field of view (FOV), 20 seconds, and a 0.2-mm voxel size. In the PreXion device, the phantom was scanned following an image acquisition protocol of 5-cm × 5-cm FOV, 19 seconds, and a 0.1-mm voxel size. Thereafter, multiplanar reformatting was performed, thereby obtaining axial sections with a thickness of 1.0 mm. The data were saved in the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine format usingPrexion3DViewer software version 2.4.1.20 (PreXion Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA) to measure the diameter of each axial image.
The diameter of the phantom was measured in sections, using 2 coordinates (An/Bn and Cn/Dn) with numbers from 2 to 7, in the depth of the channel, that is, betweenthe "points" marked with zinc oxide and eugenol. This measurement was performed using a software tool. For each axial image, measurements were made in either horizontal direction (the A-B distance) and in either vertical direction (the C-D distance), twice, with a 1-week interval, by 4 examiners (4 oral radiologists) with 5 years or more experience in the use of these measuring tools. All postprocessing procedures were carried out using the same software, Prexion3DViewer version 2.4.1.20, and the images were visualized on a 24-inch LG E 2241 LCD monitor with a matrix resolution of 1920 × 1080. The values of the 2 repetitions for each coordinate were entered into anExcel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Seattle, WA, USA), separated by examiner, by scanner, by section, and by distance (A-B and C-D).
Statistical analysis was applied to the collected data using SPSS Statistics for Windows, (version 20.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) calculations were used to verify intraobserver and interobserver agreement and to compare the accuracy (reproducibility) of the i-CAT and PreXion CBCT with the real measurements (the gold standard). The linear measurements (mm) were subjected to descriptive analysis to present the absolute and relative errors (in %) of the measurements performed on the acquisitions made with both CBCT machines in relation to the gold standard. The Student t-test was used to compare the scans to each other regarding the linear measurements. The significance level used for all tests was 5% (α = .05).
