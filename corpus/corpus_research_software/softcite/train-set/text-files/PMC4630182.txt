The migration and invasion abilities of human HCC cells transfected with miR-328/NC mimic or miR-328/NC inhibitor with or without si-PTPRJ/si-con were tested by migration and invasion assays, respectively, using the 24-well cell migration kit with 8 µm-pore polycarbonate membrane (Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA) and the invasion assay kit (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of migrated or invaded cells on the lower side of the membrane was counted at 200× magnification from ten different fields of each filter. statistical analysisSPSS software version 11.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform all statistical analyses. In this study, all experiments were performed in triplicate. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation of one representative experiment. Student's t-test was used to evaluate the continuous variables. The chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate the differences in proportion. In all cases, differences were considered statistically significant at P,0.05.Upregulation of mir-328 and/or downregulation of PTPrJ mrna associate with aggressive progression of patients with hcc
