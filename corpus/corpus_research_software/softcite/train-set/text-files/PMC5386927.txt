Results were expressed as the meanÂ±standard deviation. Differences between all other parameters for the three groups were evaluated by ANOVA followed by multiple-group comparisons. An unpaired two-tailed t test and Mann-Whitney test were used, and a P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS version 14.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.
