Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 21, IBM Inc., Armonk, NY, USA). For group comparisons, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used for normally distributed continuous variables (age); chi-square tests for categorical variables (gender, education, APOE ε4, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes, cardiovascular disease); nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn's post hoc were used for skewed distributed continuous variables (inflammatory markers). Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between inflammatory markers and primary diagnosis (NCI, CIND, or AD). The levels of inflammatory markers were included as determinants in the logistic models and were categorized into tertiles, whereas CIND and AD were listed as outcomes. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were reported for both CIND and AD. All the models were adjusted for age, gender, education, APOE ε4 carrier status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. A P-value of ,.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.
