The chi-square test was used to determine whether there is a significant difference between two groups in Fig. 2 to 6. The p value (<0.01) was used to test statistical significance of evidence. The SPSS21(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 21.0) was used to analyzed. Overall, 75% of fusion rate was seen and 25% of non-fusion rate was seen. In alendronate group, fusion was achieved in 66.7% compared to 73.9% in control group (no medication) (Fig. 2). There was no statistical difference between the two groups (p=0.599). Alendronate seems to have no effect on the fusion rate.
