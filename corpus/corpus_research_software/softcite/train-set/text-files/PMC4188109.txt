Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) tests was used to compare variables. All continuous variables are shown as the mean -standard deviation except for ANCOVA analysis (mean -standard error). To compare the relationship among HbA1c, GA and other variables, Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to assess the associations between clinical and laboratory variables. We analyzed the differences in the correlated coefficients between PCGR or HOMA-b and glycemic indices using Steiger's Z-test. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of PCGR was shown, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for separating each medication group. To determine the optimal cut-off value, the point on the ROC curve with maximum Youden index (sensitivity + specificity -1) was calculated. Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A P-value <0.05 was considered significant.
