Participant responses were analysed for frequencies, means and SDs as indicated. Participant characteristics were correlated with their interview responses. Nulliparous women were excluded from analysis of questions related to prior deliveries. Respondents with missing data were dropped from all analyses. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables and Student's t test was used for continuous variables. All analyses were performed with SAS V.9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA). Our primary outcomes of interest were facility delivery rate assessed in the community and caesarean delivery rate in a regional hospital.
