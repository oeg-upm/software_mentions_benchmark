Analysis of β-glucan synthase gene structure. The exon arrangement of the S. crispa β-glucan synthase gene was analyzed by FGENESH software (http://linux1.softberry.com/) [21] using Coprinopsis cinerea genome as a reference. Transmembrane domain of the β-glucan synthase protein was analyzed by Phobius software (http://phobius.sbc.su.se/) [22]. Phylogenetic analysis with the fungal β-glucan synthases was conducted using MEGA ver. 2.0 software.
Primary structure of the S. crispa β-glucan synthase gene. The DNA sequence with a size of 5,502 bp for the S. crispa β-glucan synthase gene was determined. Sequenceβ-Glucan Synthase from Sparassis crispa 169 comparison analysis of multiple fungal β-glucan synthase genes revealed that the determined sequence was incomplete, lacking approximately 400 bp at the 3' end region. The β-glucan synthase gene was analyzed by the FGENESH program to predict the open reading frame using the C. cinerea genome as the reference. As a result, the β-glucan synthase gene was found to consist of 10 exon sequences separated by nine introns. The predicted size of the mRNA was 4,728 bp. The mRNA encoded a polypeptide consisting of 1,576 amino acid residues. Since mushroom β-glucan synthases of this type are generally composed of 1,6401 ,650 amino acid residues, the S. crispa β-glucan synthase in this study is estimated to be devoid of approximately 70 amino acids at its C-terminus. However, the protein regions critical for enzyme function, including the active site, are mostly contained within the 1,500 amino acid residues for fungal β-glucan synthase [5]. The amino acid sequence for S. crispa β-glucan synthase is estimated to carry most of the information required for the analysis of enzyme function.
Fungal β-glucan synthase is an integral membrane protein, consisting of two cytosolic and two transmembrane domains [1, 23]. Topology of S. crispa β-glucan synthase was analyzed by the Phobius program to predict the functional domain regions. As shown in Fig. 2A, S. crispa β-glucan synthase was predicted to consist of 15 loops (L1~L15) and 14 transmembrane α-helices (H1~H14). Catalytic domains C1 and C2, homologous to Fks1, were found in L1 and L9, respectively. The two domains were separated by the transmembrane domain TM1, which was shown to comprise eight transmembrane α-helices (H1~H8). TM2, composed of six transmembrane α-helices (H7~H14), was located at the C-terminus of the protein (Fig. 2B). The large loop structures L1, L9, and L11 with lengths of 367, 573, and 143 aa, respectively, were located at the cytosolic side of the membrane, implying their function in the synthesis of β-glucan. In the yeast homologue Fks1, the L9 loop was reported to play a critical role in enzyme catalysis [24]. Mutations in the core catalytic regionof the Fks1 L9 loop, ranging 830~1,050 aa, caused more than 80% reduction in catalytic activity, as shown by the mutant strains fks1-1144 (L872F, E907K, N982S) and fks1-1154 (K877N, A899S, Q977P) [25]. The L9 loop of S. crispa β-glucan synthase was highly homologous to that of Fks1 (Fig. 3). The amino acid residues reported to affect the catalytic activity of Fks1 were well conserved in S. crispa β-glucan synthase (Fig. 3, shaded amino acids).
