Human melanoma (Mel-29, -23 and -6) and breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) were injected s.c. in the right flank of 5-to 6-week-old male and female athymic mice (Punj et al, 2004; Jia et al, 2011; Mehta et al, 2011). When tumours reached 3 mm in diameter, animals were randomised into control (20 mice) and treatment (10 mice) groups, and injected i.p. with DTIC (5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno) imidazole-4-carboxamide), 4 mg kg À 1 , 3 Â /week (melanoma); paclitaxel, 12.8 mg kg À 1 i.p., days 10, 14, 21 and 25 (breast cancer); or p28 10 or 20 mg kg À 1 i.p. 3 Â /week for 30 days. Although p28 is rapidly cleared (t ½ 0.06 h; clearance (ml kg À 1 h À 1 ) 2159), it is also rapidly taken up (Vdss (ml kg À 1 ) 297) at pharmacologically active doses (Punj et al, 2004; Jia et al, 2011; Mehta et al, 2011). p28 is also stable in murine serum (t 1/2 B60 min) (Punj et al, 2004; Jia et al, 2011; Mehta et al, 2011) assuring a continuous release of the mature peptide. At necropsy, tumours were dissected, freed of fat and weighed. Statistical comparisons were performed by analysis of variance ANOVA (control vs treatment) (GraphPad InStat ver. 3.0, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Docking simulation of p28-p53 complex. ClusPro identified motifs spanning the L 1 loop (aa 112-124), within aa 139-146, a region within the S 7 -S 8 loop (aa 214-236) and R282 and L289 of the p53 DBD (Tu et al, 2008) that were involved in the binding between p28 and p53 (Figure 1A). Molecular surface and electrostatic potential plots of the p53DBD were calculated by DeepView ver. 4.0.3 (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland) (Figure 1B). A blue, red and white colour gradient represents positive, negative and neutral (including hydrophobic aa) potentials on the molecular surface, respectively. The DNAbinding surface of the p53DBD is highly cationic (blue). In contrast, the p28-binding area is essentially neutral (white), suggesting that electrostatic interaction may not have a role in p28 binding to p53 (Figure 1B). The amino-acid composition of the predicted p28-binding sites on p53 was FLHSGTAVTCTYPA LTPQWEGSDCTHRL or 43% hydrophobic, 36% neutral and 21% hydrophilic residues. p28 bound to 10 of 13 aa (77%) in the L 1 loop that were 50% hydrophobic, 40% neutral and 10% hydrophilic residues and 7 of 23 aa (30%), 14% hydrophobic, 43% neutral and 43% hydrophilic, in the S 7 -S 8 loops (Figure 1C). The four amino acids residing between residues 139 and 147 predicted to bind p28 are 50% hydrophobic and 50% neutral. These residues and the L 1 and S 7 -S 8 loops are not located at or near the DNA-binding surface of p53 (R248 and R273 are direct DNA-binding residues on p53), suggesting p28 does not interfere with the ability of p53 to bind to DNA (Figure 1B). The ClusPro best score model also predicted that amino-acid residues LSTAAMQVVGDYLKDD of p28 bind to p53. Fifty per cent of the predicted residues are hydrophobic, again suggesting that hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interaction is essential to the formation of the p28-p53 complex (Figure 1B). These results agree with computational docking (De Grandis et al, 2007) studies demonstrating that azurin binds to the L 1 and S 7 -S 8 loops of p53 through interaction of non-polar residues at the interface, creating a short-range hydrophobic interaction. A sequence map of the amino acids predicted to be involved in p28 binding and their relationship to the known binding sites of the E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate p53 is illustrated in Figure 1D. p28 does not bind to motifs shown to bind either HDM2 or Pirh2.
